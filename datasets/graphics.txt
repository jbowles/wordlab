DMorf (Dave's Morph ,  I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's TGA Assembler) are available in the MSDOS_UPLOADS directoryon the wuarchive . They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions , dmorfx . exe and dtax . exe ,  you can also find a version of aaplay . exethere ,  with which you can view files you create with dta . exe ordtax . exe . I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing away the afternoons since .   The programmes are all a bit buggy anddefinitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses ,  but they are verywell written .  The interface is frustrating at first ,  but it gets easy once youfigure out the tricks . I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morphwithout using the splines option .   Not sure why ,  since I don't havethe source .   I think it was written for TP 6 . 0 . If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing to work right ,  tell me; it took me several hours the first timejust to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then it would work ... >JNA>jna8182@usl . edu-Ryanrap@cis . ufl . eduFrom :  kph2q@onyx . cs .

While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here , he's using a common misconception that should be corrected .     Mach banding will occur for any image .   It is not the colorquantization you see when you don't have enough bits .   It is thehuman eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities . The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter onthe brighter side and darker on the darker side . --Andre--              Andre Yew andrey@cco . caltech . edu (131 . 215 . 139 . 2)From :  oehler@picard . cs . wisc . edu (Eric Oehler)Subject :  Translating TTTDDD to DXF or Swiv3D .

I'm using RenderMan library on my NeXT but there is no documentation about NeXTSTEP version of RenderMan available .  I can create very complicated scenes and render them using surface shaders ,  but I can not bring them to life by applying shadows and reflections . As far as I understand I have to define environmental and shadows maps to produce reflections and shadows ,  but I do not know how to use them .

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos froma 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method .  Displaying all 256 levelssynchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds .  Afterexperimenting with different aperture settings and screenbrightnesses we found a range that worked well ,  giving respectablecontrast .  The quality of the images was pretty good .  There were novisible contrast bands . To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255different 1 bit frames .  The first contained a dot only for pixelsthat had value 255 ,  the second only for pixels that had value 254 , etc .  These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that wasvery fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence .  Creating theseframes sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac ,  but the camerashutter was closed during that time anyway .  And yes ,  we wrotedirectly to the screen memory .  Mea culpa . Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in thetop left corner of the screen instead of the center .  It tookan extra week to have the film developed and printed ,  because theprocessors took the trouble to manually move the all images intothe center of the print .

Why didn't you create 8 grey-level images ,  and display them for1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 ...  time slices ? This requires the same total exposure time ,  and the same precision intiming ,  but drastically reduces the image-preparation time ,  no ? -- Kenneth Sloan                   Computer and Information Sciencessloan@cis . uab . edu               University of Alabama at Birmingham(205) 934-2213                  115A Campbell Hall ,  UAB Station (205) 934-5473 FAX              Birmingham ,  AL 35294-1170From :  lex@optimla . aimla . com (Lex van Sonderen)Subject :  Re :  Rumours about 3DO  ???
