Displaying all 256 levelssynchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. Afterexperimenting with different aperture settings and screenbrightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectablecontrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were novisible contrast bands.To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixelsthat had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that wasvery fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating theseframes sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camerashutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrotedirectly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in thetop left corner of the screen instead of the center. It tookan extra week to have the film developed and printed, because theprocessors took the trouble to manually move the all images intothe center of the print.

Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on yourcalculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is307,200 which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but Idon't think it is a BIOS mode.  I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can dothat either.  If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and640x480.

Features===========DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC: - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA) - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale - color-space selection - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for   VGA and many Super-VGAs...4. Technical information========================The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2](not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zerocoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Maindifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supportedalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option touse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturationdominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality ofthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributedover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space pointsis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at theexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lyingsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximatedby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead ofconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to thelower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes thanto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improveon NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redishareas....--Stefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.deFrom: scrowe@hemel.bull.co.uk (Simon Crowe)Subject: Point within a polygonI am looking for an algorithm to determine if a given point is bound by a polygon.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing>  program.I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines andpolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number ofpoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, theJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane intoexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line liescompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.Now, the phrasing of this question says "if a line intersects a polygon", sothis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) isto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try tosolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in anew language called PostScript.  (See "PostScript Language", by Adobe SystemsIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program thatdraws the line L and the polygon P, and then "outputs" the answer.  By"output", we mean the program executes a command called "showpage", whichactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quickexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thusthe original problem.There are two small problems with this approach. 	(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the	reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of	Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.	(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in	other words, will it halt?	Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a	Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is	undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn	out to be undecidable.I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finiteprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.A couple of references might be:1.

The first one is Ray (or half line) method. Inthis method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection pointof the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases whichmay make you headache.The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point andall the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of thesuccessive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, thenit is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.My experience tells the second method is relible.Hope this helps.YehUSCFrom: channui@austin.ibm.com (Christopher Chan-Nui)Subject: Re: Two pointing devices in one COM-port?Bob Davis (sonny@trantor.harris-atd.com) wrote:: In article <C4tKGM.1v6@unix.portal.com>, wil@shell.portal.com (Ville V Walveranta) writes:: |> : |>         Is there any way to connect two pointing devices to one serial: |>         port?

Who are the leading|> companies,|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visualdatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  Thisis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilottraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping ofthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motionof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics systemmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complexdata representations.Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhapsdue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what wasvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (thegraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constantframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in generaldoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified theUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-timeoperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-timeoperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, noteven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only ourmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation dueto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environmentsrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-timemulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systemson the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularlyimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is anunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to developVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).   Generic clients.   Customizable servers.   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily        attached.Functionality:  Client:   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to   other users.   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)    o User Interface Panels    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for	faster frame rates)    o Mouse and Keyboard Input   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)  Server(s):   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is   provided in this release for potential world server developers:    o Transparent Client Management    o Client Message Handling   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache ofaccepting and   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - theapplication writer   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension        initialisers you want.    o Event Handler Registration:        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)    o Collision Detection Registration:        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide        some basic information to the collision detection management software.        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects    from which to choose.    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:    o Provide an initWorld function:        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus        any initialization you want to do.    o Provide a positionObject function:        This is where you determine where to place a new client.    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.    o Provide a getWorldType function:        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.    o Provide an animateWorld function:        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit        (to avoid outrunning the clients).    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the    three world servers I've provided:        generic - 81 lines        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                           stairs!

Mycomment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendorsthat supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe thatwe *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of theCrimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at aprevious site on the understanding *that* architecture would be aroundfor a while, rather than being flushed.Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has tokeep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myselfpressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the booksjust before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired ofgetting boned in the process.Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so wearen't entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA,for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labsand organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computersevery year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis.The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through theentire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  Thatmeans that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when Ihave the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase oneprevious poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some othervendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years.And every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how Icould have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we'resupported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).Now you'll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in acorner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.							spl-- Steve Lamont, SciViGuy -- (619) 534-7968 -- spl@szechuan.ucsd.eduSan Diego Microscopy and Imaging Resource/UC San Diego/La Jolla, CA 92093-0608"My other car is a car, too."                 - Bumper strip seen on I-805From: cheinan@access.digex.com (Cheinan Marks)Subject: Re: Please Recommend 3D Graphics Library For Mac.: Robert G.

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSIONNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter forC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free to contact me.The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls fromthe FPU version to make it run faster.Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.********Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:-------------------------------------Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of drawing three-dimensional scenes? Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure of three-dimensional molecules?And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from actually doing it?Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to do with this package???' , read on.GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallelprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showingoff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explainwhat it all means later on). GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines withdata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routinesto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines soyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3Dgraphics and how to use the package.If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use fora lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

Lindley                     published by WileyIt addresses reading/writing to/from PCX/TIFF files; image acquisition, manipulation and storage; and has source code in the book. The source is primarily written in Turbo C and naturally has conversion possibilities. I have converted some of it to Quick C. Naturally, the code has some problems in the book - as usuall. Typos, syntax, etc. are problems. It can be a good learning experience for someone who is studying C. There is also a companion disk with source available for order and $50.00. Overall, the book is not bad. I acquired the book at WaldenSoftware.From: rschmitt@shearson.com (Robert Schmitt)Subject: Re: Please Recommend 3D Graphics Library FWhat hardware do plan to run on?

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input inaddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 graylevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how toformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initialproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from aparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the videosignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However theydid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, butthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and theywould call Japan, etc.Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel imagesfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's notlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information ongetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I wouldgreatly appreciate your sending it to me.Thanks.Allan WeberSignal & Image Processing InstituteUniversity of Southern Californiaweber@sipi.usc.eduFrom: renggli@masg1.epfl.ch (loris renggli)Subject: Need graph display/editI am looking for a program that is capable of displaying a graphwith nodes and links and with the possibility to edit interactivelythe graph : add one node, change one link etc...Actually, a very _simple_ X11 program would be ok; all I need is toput some "boxes" (i.e. the nodes ) on a pane and be able tomanipulate them with the mouse (move, add or delete boxes).Does anyone know if such program is available ?Thanks for any help !!------------------------------------------------------------------------Loris RENGGLI                          phone  : +41-21-6934230Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  fax    : +41-21-6934303Math.

As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the PowerSeries parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at aparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphicsarchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every18 months to 2 years.These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they becomealmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a newplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If wedon't, we become uncompetitive.From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets yourcurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, butif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Repfor one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Someof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such asthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Seriesmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtaina guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or ChallengeR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.|> |> Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to|> keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself|> pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books|> just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of|> getting boned in the process.|> If that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings ormis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy ourcustomer base.|> Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we|> aren't entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA,|> for instance) are.

I originallywrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someonehere will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, butare missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as anintro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a*** different version.The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  Theyare fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes,anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a"virtual screen", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image withno transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copyareas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included asimple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256color GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo programthat bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three "windows".The whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip It is zipped with pkzip 2.04gIt is completely in the public domain, as far as I'm concerned.  Do withit whatever you like.

It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithmeither. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well asthe circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this centerperpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center ofthe sphere.3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. Thisgives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere'sorigin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center toany of the original points.I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formedby the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains thecenter of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersectingat a point. This might be easier to implement.-Stevespworley@netcom.comFrom: HURH@FNAL.FNAL.GOV (Patrick Hurh)Subject: Rayshade to DXF,RIB,etc..

Kyanko (rob@rjck.UUCP)From: renew@blade.stack.urc.tue.nl (Rene Walter)Subject: CView answersA very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to postit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the mostannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has todo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no controlover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its"current directory".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CViewdoesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colourinformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the "dithering", again writinganother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing thissecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it doesthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file toyour screen again.  (It does this last "recopy" operation for its"fit to screen" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.) The result of this process is the following:       1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the        dithering and writes to the screen card.        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which        there was room on the disk.This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the generalidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in detailsabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficientdisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can bevery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excessof 6 Meg free disk space.CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file froma floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on thefloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FATtable? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly insertedfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possiblyunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for aprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Filesmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves thehi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at oncewhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take tosort a directory listing?With much thanks to the originator of this article. +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+ |        Rene Walter          |          renew@stack.urc.tue.nl           | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | "Will I drown in tears of sorrow, Is there hope for tomorrow,           | |  Will this world ever get better, Can't we all just live together       | |  I don't wanna live in strife  , I just wanna live my life              | |  I deserve to have a future..."                                         | |                                     -The Good Girls    "Future"         | +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+From: camter28@astro.ocis.temple.edu (Carter Ames)Subject: Re: alt.raytrace (potential group)    Yes, please create the group alt.raytrace soon!!I'm hooked on pov.geez. like I don't have anything better to do....OH!! dave letterman is on...From: g.coulter@daresbury.ac.uk (G.

Any three of them must benon-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surfaceof a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise eitherthey cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them).A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BCand CA  meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle.This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All pointson this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (infact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the planecontaining this normal and D (if D lies on the normal anyplane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right anglesto the ABC one.Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumferenceof the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on thenormal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicularbisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D isnot in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal).Algorithm:Is the sphere well defined?    (1) Check that A and B are not coincident (=> failure).    (2) Find the line AB and check that C does not lie on it (=> failure).

I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a databaseformat used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program storesthe points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a little and it seems that the points are stored in the orderthey are drawn.Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the points are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert,but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know which direction the polygon should be visible from.If DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround?The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each onein the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.

It uses few calculations however, basically it is severalcomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after thetransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on thescreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  Mymethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on thescreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back ofsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, somerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you arelooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video captureusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spotquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one(1.5).   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quitenicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that itwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then heincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.    Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't knowwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktimecould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was havinga little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This wasfrom memory!   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or somehardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I canclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

Can do simple display,  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions  [PC and Macs]LabVIEW 2---------  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the  "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual  instrument.  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has  utility functions for memory management data communications and  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for  the development of custom code.)Ultimage Concept VI-------------------  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and  characterization.  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can  be imported.  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom  modules.  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even  hole filling.  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494  707-579-1733IPLab Spectrum--------------  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a  movie command for cycling through windows.Macintosh-based tools=====================NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more---------------------------------  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been  developed by Spyglass.  Spyglass, Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign, IL  61820 (217) 355-6000  fax: 217 355 8925NIH IMAGE---------  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table.

Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112Adobe Photoshop---------------  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA  94039-7900 415-961-4400ColorStudio and ImageStudio---------------------------  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a  variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close  hues, color range and mask.ImageStudio: Don't know...

Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283Digital Darkroom----------------  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to  select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide  selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.  Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

It has  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching  tool and it is very good for this purpose."  "Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its  development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of  other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt  language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining  convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down  menus etc...

MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109Image Analyst-------------  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in  radiographs.  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or  a disk-stored image.  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and  can do image arithmetic, etc.    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.     There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and  Australia to name a few.

Feature Description  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of  modules.  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and  ratioing.  Host Configuration Requirements  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific  applications programs.  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be  interactively driven through this control.  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be  added to further enhance referenced imagery.  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional  processing of remote sensed data.

Been around for  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display"HIPS----(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well  as a huge user-contributed library.  Feature description  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users  become effective using HIPS on their first day.  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual  pages, and on-line documentation.  Host Configuration Requirements  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.  Availability  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse.

Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs.CIA World Map II----------------[  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.  If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for  every half degree longitude and latitude.   A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.NCAR data---------  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.UNC data tapes with voxel data--------------  There are 2 "public domain" tapes with data for the comparison and  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTDNASA----  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following  address for more info:     National Space Science Date Center     Goddard Space Flight Center     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771     Telephone: (301) 286-6695     Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov  The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.  Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log  in as 'NODIS' (no password).  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,  no parity, one stop). At the "Enter Number:" prompt, enter MD and  carriage return. When the system responds "Call Complete," enter a few  more carriage returns to get the "Username:" and log in as 'NODIS' (no  password).  NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of  what's there is available at present.Earth Sciences Data-------------------  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including  imagery. This listing is called "Earth Sciences Resources on Internet",  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]  in the directory COGS under the name "internet.resources.earth.sci"  Some sites include:  aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images  ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from        Magellan and Viking missions etc.        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole        archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an        e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter        to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the        subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:        send SPACE Index        send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91        (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the        email server at present)  vab02.larc.nasa.gov [128.155.23.47]: pub/gifs/misc/landsat -	Landsat photos in GIF and JPEG format[ It was shut down - nfotis; anyone has a copy of this archive?? ]Others------  Daily values of river discharge, streamflow, and daily weather data is  available from EarthInfo, 5541 Central Ave., Boulder CO  80301.

Polhemus makes a 6D input device (actually a couple of models)  that senses position (3D) and *orientation* (+3D) based on electromagnetic  field interference.  This equipment is also incorporated in the  VPL Dataglove.  This hardware is also called ISOTRACK, from Keiser Aerospace.Ascension Technology makes a similar 3D input device.There is a company, Applied Sciences(?), that makes a 3D inputdevice (position only) based on speed of sound triangulation.c. A company that specializes in digitizing is Viewpoint. You can ask   for Viewpoint's _free_ 100 page catalog full of ready to    ship datasets from categories such as cars, anatomy, aircraft,sports,   boats, trains, animals and others.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles========================================= First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTPlist above.24-bit scanning:----------------  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll  house supplies.  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.Books with textures:--------------------  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also  a wide variety of stock art is available.  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your  graphics work. Their address is:	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,	00196 Rome Italy,	Piazzale Flaminio, 19	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60Texture Libraries:------------------a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.   Contact:   Mannikin Sceptre Graphics   1600 Indiana Ave.   Winter Park, FL 32789   Phone: (407) 384-9484   FAX: (407) 647-7242b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine   by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point   versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.   Written by Steve Worley.

Introduction to rendering algorithms========================================a. Ray-Tracing:---------------  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would  suggest:   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines  (erich@eye.com)There's a more concise reference also:  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in  "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)--------------------------A good reference is:        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.c. Others:----------???[ More info is needed -- nfotis ]========================================================================15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:================================================a. Teapot ?-----------"Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the wholestory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also hasthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframemodel of the teapot.IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column "Jim Blinn's Corner" describesan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations forexample are used.The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to getthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles ata specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs atessellation at any specified resolution.b. Space Shuttle ?------------------Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttledatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):model1:A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).Payload doors non-existent.Units: unknown.Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. Hesaid there is no proprietary information associated with it.model2:The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it ingondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geohanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.datamodel3:The triangles' model.This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He didnot mention any restriction on the model's distribution.model4:The NASA model.The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions3473 vertices.2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex, 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex, 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).Payload doors closed.Units: inches.Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the modelProprietary info: unknownmodel5:The old shuttle model.The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.104 vertices.452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).Payload doors open.Units: meters.We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, forsome years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisorScott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.========================================================================16. Image annotation software=============================a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a  rasterfile.b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not  sure exactly what they are.  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not  be redistributed without permission.  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the   position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen   color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest  X11 archive.========================================================================17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers  (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports  Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a  freebie if you want it"  "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets   comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,   menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability   of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an   encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap   manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only   color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets   developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget   set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers   using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other   Motif widgets.  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)   simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these  data graphically.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)===================================================GRASS-----  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,  although it is reported to have significant image processing  capabilities.  Feature Descriptions  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68  Host Configuration Requirements  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented  in raster (grid-cell) form.  Availability  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.  This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and  "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu  Support  Listserv mailing lists:  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.Microstation Imager-------------------  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.  Feature Description  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available  for GIS applications.  Host Configuration Requirements  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.PCI---  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of  remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.  The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI  database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.  "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your  particular application/interest calls for.  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from  a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default  directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI  data structures (database file, parameter file).  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the  Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different  "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the  graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to  contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this  can go into the PCI "database").  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would  display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"  in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these  areas.SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)--------------------------------  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X  for display.MAP II------  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.CLRview-------  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)   in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

For example, given 5 points on the offset, can you findthe original ellipse analytically?I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year,but I failed. Under the pressure, I had to use other method - nonlinearprogramming technique to deal with this problem approximately.Any ideas will be greatly appreciated.

(I'm a littlefuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe inSanta Monica, CA. From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and HalJosephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. Wegot to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec(which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft)... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).Note however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.CompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTimedoes indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was statedabove... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large sizethen it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). Theprice of generality... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of moviesoften, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quickon the latest 040 machines.I'm not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM inthe 3DO box.

JPEG is designed for compressing eitherfull-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or linedrawings.JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does ithandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those typesof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEGrespectively.JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn'tquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves muchof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notablythe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small detailsof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, thesmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they areinvisible to the eye.A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied byadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* smallfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing imagearchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if youaren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, youcan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.[2]  Why use JPEG?There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files acrossnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference indisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have toconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Evenwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG imagethan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, usingJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order tostore or transmit an image more cheaply.It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, thetime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than theextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenetposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete asblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailedin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images amongpeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the firstthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color orgray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs andsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixelsthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeedby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but theyshould be avoided in JPEG files.)JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixelsadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, thissort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairlyoften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness isparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall betweenscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex andsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scaleimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale imagesof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether youshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, onlyapplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start froma GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEGcan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I havehandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first threefiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B.File	   Size in bytes		Commentsship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25			 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were			 of poorer image quality than this.ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smallerthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as theGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff byselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of theinformation", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;it's not a percentage of anything.The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable fromthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from oneobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except forexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce afile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able togo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, youmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and areprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 isabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)

XV reduces all images to 8 bitsinternally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bitdisplay (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV toconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to checkthe "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file willbe blurry.Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  TheImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormappeddisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or thebasic free JPEG software.Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latestrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the currentxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are saidto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.MS-DOS:This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface isnot flashy, but it's functional.Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  Thecurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPUand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows andOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fiton the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that itslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is abit tricky; read the directions carefully!A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface isalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger thanscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and bothare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zipor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-inVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complainsthat the driver is missing.)A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking aroundthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortlyand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latestrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality ispoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of theseviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programsto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If youhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try tofind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.)The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (orjpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOScompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they willconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; inparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The majoradvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietaryJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it isnot readable on non-PC platforms.Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulationpackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programsis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this documentrefers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you shouldexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are severalInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USAmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 filesin (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you canretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings incomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.Microsoft Windows:There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversionprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frillsviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while itdecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out thedecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEGfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other usefulfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it'san excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available fromftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment andslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirrorsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,which is roughly 25% faster.)ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promisingcontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point ithas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, thecurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, filepub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version willbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screenmode, not in a window.OS/2:The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderatoris not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4./pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.Macintosh:Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part ofthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be runningSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also installthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can getQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster andconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, isnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 fordetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing imagesthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also canconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a bigimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 andQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best colorimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView canview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it'sthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on atypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it downto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most otherviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some peoplelike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is verywell thought out.GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF andPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latestversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, butit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversioncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot ofplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter canload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet ifyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, tryconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, isavailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIFconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using thisprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, andGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixiefrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it'sreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it producesrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is anunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does notintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, calledPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trashit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a muchcleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note thatPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, butit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it onolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can'tuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of adownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If youdon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although notall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEGplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloadedJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.Amiga:(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive atamiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of thisarchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a goodchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being ageneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can readseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo versionis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images largerthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, evencapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  Thecurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirrorsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory issupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run underAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packagesthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, andImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both aredistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulationsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is anotherwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas fromamiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, fileAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, manybased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanksto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, withoutso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG","VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk spaceit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.Atari ST:The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.Acorn Archimedes:!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and viewJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handleJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can befound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available byregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/writefunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other imageformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but notnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.Portable software for almost any system:If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the freeJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have adisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targaor PPM 24-bit image files.There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up everyday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you findthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whetherthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it canhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases arenot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the IndependentJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current releaseis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget toretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you mayprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available onCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearestcomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQarticle "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and imagefiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in otherprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we havetested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement inproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as withanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like tocontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, thecomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representativecolors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is somethingof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck withthe standard usage though.)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for mostimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impacton the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except atthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for displayon 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, whatcomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a littledifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probablycome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required todisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the imagesource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk aboutthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to countthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give youdifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally seeposted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), butnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in itspalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that thesender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender'squantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors thanwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorerimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantizationalgorithm, you're out of luck.For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image qualityfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's displayhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of futureimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research inthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEGimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what wassent.It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rathershoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGAdisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than youneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two colorquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it'salso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to usehigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and innormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to bedisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the averageGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit displayhardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays onworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is alreadyobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of theirdisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing imagesin a machine-independent fashion.[8]  How does JPEG work?The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosinetransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropycoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee diddefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees thefinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, thislossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEGalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very fewimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficientquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEGalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors invarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixelvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhapshalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEGprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guaranteesbit-for-bit accuracy.If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with lessthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into theJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with aHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee wasprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the internationalstandards organizations.Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree ona common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence ofofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible withanybody else's.The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some workthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have definedtwo JPEG-based file formats:  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports    pixels and not much else.  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the    mix will do anything to improve this situation.Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendorsof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercialproducts will adhere to one or both standards.I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF inpicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; theTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is stillunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is welldefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest commondenominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTimesoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF andQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs areavailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editorthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIFby hand; see section 11 for details.Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF andImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-formatfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likelyto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),    try stripping off everything before that.In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is	"begin" line	M_]C_X ...whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with	"begin" line	M:'-I ...If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble ofdownloading non-JFIF files.[12]  What about arithmetic coding?The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final outputof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usuallyproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by theJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licensesfrom these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implementand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubiousat best.)At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry aboutarithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify thepotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in thefuture.  Stay tuned for further details.[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you coulddecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress itwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an alteredimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost thefirst time around.The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompressit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get anidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventuallydegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generationoutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error canbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be thatcompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the originalquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, butthat's a mighty limited capability!)The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage andtransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediateformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you areready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if youconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the originalfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG fromthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimumloss of quality.The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, tomake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher qualitysetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained insection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colorsdon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the bestcandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offerthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don'texpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those createddirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may haveto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-throughJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-colorborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharpborder boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windowssystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painlessway to do this.)cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, butfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoidimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higherQ setting may not be necessary.)Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to foolyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often ofsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixelstogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  Thetrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequencycolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEGfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would havegotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color thatyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapidcolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing willoften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size ofthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output imagethan you'd get without smoothing.With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothingcapability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handeddithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regularfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strongsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blurthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processingwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such aspnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother isa LOT faster than pnmconvol...The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably agood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about theimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.---------------------For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software inparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.-- 			tom lane			organizer, Independent JPEG GroupInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu	BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegieFrom: uk02183@nx10.mik.uky.edu (bryan k williams)Subject: Re: CView answersWell, the temp file thing creates an obvious problem: it is impossible to usecview for viewing CD-ROM based picture collections.

Do an intersection calculation in the plane in2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel whichwon't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the linesfrom the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.

There is a sphere of in radius.This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th pointby taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be producedit can also be achieved byIf all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.(4 points being colinear => coplanar)Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 pointshas been found is trivial.>An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed>by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the>center of the sphere.

On the drawing you have a set ofreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using YaronDanon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program whichconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you clickthe mouse.Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that comeout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant waysfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because thescanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there aresuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion andcontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,scanner errors and what have you.The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so "global"adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, orrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm forremoving such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets ofpoints Reference(x,y) (the known true values)DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply toDistortedData to remove the errors.I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distortedreference points as resulting from the projection of a "bumpy" 3dsurface, solving for the surface and then "flattening" it to removethe errors in the other data points.Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?Thanks,EarlFrom: havardn@edb.tih.no (Haavard Nesse,o92a)Subject: HELP!!!

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,    music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far    exceed their technical skills.    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar    representions, a confounded user asks: "What does it all mean?"    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for    composing imagery for understanding.    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the    computer graphics context.

Below is a very shortdescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,feel free to poke me via e-mail.================================================================*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.   Consider deleting these edges.1) Now, there are two goals:    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured        using the digitized (x,y)'s).2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For   example:    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the       Reference(x,y).     b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge       the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength).        Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Considerhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insiston the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want tobalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in lengthof the edges.WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must beobserved (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, andyou can't allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both ofthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion ofindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from theoriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time wasprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try andchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have morecompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider havingevery point interact with every other point....but first read up onlinear solutions to the n-body problem.There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings onsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

Schmidt)Subject: outlining of spline surface	About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared tobe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering ifanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published solutions to it.	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by tworoughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentiallystarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extantbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw the object we 1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable	measure.2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment	of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface.3) Depth sort the triangles4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw	and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge	colored with a special "edge color"	It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of theproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps inthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.They involve both rasterization problems and problems resultingfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problemsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in thisarea.-ThanksFrom: sp1marse@kristin (Marco Seirio)Subject: Flat globeDoes anybody have an algorithm for "flattening" out a globe, or any otherparametric surface, that is definied parametrically.

Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotapeis harder than it looks.  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are very different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  Whilethere is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard toget your hands on and costs quite a bit.	If you have access to an Amiga computer, that has anNTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files bymodem and tape them from the NTSC output.  Unfortunately, thiswould be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchyanimation unless you had a good Amiga animation program.	Otherwise, see if your local public access cablestation has equipment that you can use.From: ricardo@rchland.vnet.ibm.com (Ricardo Hernandez Muchado)Subject: Re: Newsgroup SplitIn article <1quvdoINN3e7@srvr1.engin.umich.edu>, tdawson@engin.umich.edu (Chris Herringshaw) writes:|> Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of|> doing this.

Everyone,Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guessmy question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle whichrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipseand its offset is same everywhere.This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs thepositions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse stillan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American IndutrialStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which wasimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also soldinternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And mostimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last yearto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of thisproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entireor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse froma quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is notanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make thingscomplicated. Please give me a hint.I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.However, so many people involved in the problem "sphere from 4 poits".Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?Please post here and let the others share our interests (I got several emails from our netters, they said they need thesummary of the answers).YehUSCFrom: zyeh@caspian.usc.edu (zhenghao yeh)Subject: Re: Newsgroup SplitIn article <1quvdoINN3e7@srvr1.engin.umich.edu>, tdawson@engin.umich.edu (Chris Herringshaw) writes:|> Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of|> doing this.

Background of the problem:	I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a 	mapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d. The area in this domain	which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming	loop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments.	For the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.	My problem is this :	The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller	cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell	is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole ,	else it is trivially rejected. 	Does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo. 	somewhere for doing this.	Any help would be appreciated.

It depends on what kind of the polygons. 	Convex - simple, concave - trouble, concave with loop(s)	inside - big trouble.	Of cause, you can use the box test to avoid checking	each edges.

We use it toproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our localnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, theimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export thevideo to the Net.We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs foruse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant forcommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B rolldigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted asan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the makerof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has beenunable to deliver.  Our system produces "near VHS" quality at 30 fields persecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that somefind distracting.If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands ofdifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've everused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodologyand the user interface.The total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21" Apple mon-itor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),Composite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.For you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a qualitythat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform moreeffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based systemwill look better.We use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.

This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago. IMHO, it is design error of 'xv'; there should not be such confusingerrors in programs.There's two errors:  -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the   original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of   original 24bit should be a special case  -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer   -- the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the   best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier   quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases   in saving the image, if at all) ==clip====clip==[ ..deleted..]It is limit of *XV*, but not limit of design.It is error in design.It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs;jpeg is not designed to that.As matter of fact, I'm sure when XV were designed 24bit displays wereknown. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images onlyat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program thewhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.That were not done and now we have -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format) -the program has human interface errors.Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format withoutclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.[ ..deleted.. ]==clip==Some new items follows.==clip==I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24option than with default option we have.The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)the same than used in ppmquant.If you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I foundthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.I don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.So, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used inrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so Ican say nothing about it.)==clip====clip==Some minor bugs in human interface are:Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happensthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrongplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come aboutfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.Also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboardand mouse for XV after the image is completed.Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just whenI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressingsthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.In the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XVupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values firstand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to beupdated when the setting are not ready yet.I suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.==clip==From: andreasa@dhhalden.no (ANDREAS ARFF)Subject: Re: Newsgroup SplitIn article <1quvdoINN3e7@srvr1.engin.umich.edu> tdawson@engin.umich.edu (Chris Herringshaw) writes:>From: tdawson@engin.umich.edu (Chris Herringshaw)>Subject: Newsgroup Split>Date: 19 Apr 1993 19:43:52 GMT>Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of>doing this.

(formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in theprocess of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0 and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C ExponentGraphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products. X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts: 1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types   available through a large collection of X resources.2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers.3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization.4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback.5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget    library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar    to X programmers.6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.   This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical   layout of an application. C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts: 1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library   is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C   standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C.2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse    interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control   with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization.3. Large collection of high-level application functions for "two-call"   graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available   with minimal programming effort.4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling   the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot   the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can    control the event loop.

We had one last kicker inthe form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions overits lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.| Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to| keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself| pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books| just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of| getting boned in the process.Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI supportor sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folksto misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes therewill be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what youare referring to).Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can resultin good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks intosystems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)| Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we| aren't entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA,| for instance) are.

Digital immortality.The basic idea behind "digital immortality" is that computer networks   are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on themwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be theartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in differentformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll bethere...and someone will dig them up.   If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critiqueand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closesand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hangas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons. Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your owncopies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...that's what they're here for.---------------------------------------------------------------WHERE?             OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.    	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site			sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite 	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)Merely "anonymous FTP" to either site on Internet and change to theappropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the "bin"command to make sure you're in binary.OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around NorthAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply ofOTIStuff...	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron-------------------------------------------------------------- HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?              What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-putit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated worksare also welcome.OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bittougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    JPG files to a standard GIF format. OTIS also accepts animation files.      When you submit image files, please send me email at the same timestating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to beused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for peopleto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'llbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of emailing).If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely sendcopies to:The OTIS Projectc/o Ed StastnyPO BX 241113Omaha, NE 68124-1113I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line description of the image that we can include in the infofile in thedirectory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to whatthe images are to be named, include those as well.   Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, pleasecontact me and we'll arrange things.If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5"disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBMcompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF orJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rathernot have to.At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as theycan stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can senda blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to get a slab-o-OTIS.As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  Email me for current archive size and directory.--------------------------------------------------------------------DISTRIBUTION?The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it isnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format toanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport theappropriate text files along with the images.   It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post imagesfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them soparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much aspossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favoriteBBS system....or even just post this "info-file" there.  It would bekeen of you.--------------------------------------------------------------------USE?If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, orfull address credit).  You will either find this in the ".rm" file for    the image or series of images...or in the "Artists" directory under the Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, emailme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for you, or give you their contact information. When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artistknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some suchcompensation for their files.---------------------------------------------------------------------NAMING IMAGES?Please keep the names of your files in "dos" format.  That means, keepthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The wayI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three orfour digit "code" for the series of images, plus the series number.Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be somethinglike: 	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETCKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename willremain intact on all systems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CREATING IMAGE FILES?When creating image files, be sure to at least include your namesomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference incase they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,address or other information you'd like people to know.-----------------------------------------------------------------------HMMM?!That's about it for now.

Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS	     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights	     revert to the author/artist.

If you don't want your images distributed     	     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is	     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not 	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        	     screen-printed clothing, etc).

The problem is thatonce the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package, a header is addedto the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. Wewould like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images forfurther use on our workstations. So, here are my questions: (1) What is the Hitachi format? - I need this format so I can recognizeprecisely what to strip out. I strongly suspect that it's a compressedformat - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out theoffending header. (2) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF? It would bereally nice to find some sort of "hrftopbm" converter out there. ;) I've already searched some of the more well-known ftp sites which containgraphics formats documentation, with no luck.

We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured theprinter with the "lp" system using the parallel interface and can print postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image formatand translating the image into postscript.We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without some assurance that the product will work.Here my questions:If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is thelimiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on the printer? The Big question:Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?Please email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis.

I'm >philosophically< opposed to itbecause of its complexity.This complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers makingsome very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFFimages (though they'll save them, of course), and a generalinability to interchange images between different environmentsdespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.As the saying goes, "It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the>other<  assholes out there!"  I've had big trouble with misuse andabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (andunnecessary) complexity of the format.In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalizedemphasis mine):"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designedto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes afair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined inthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will beable to import any TIFF image, since there are so manyimage-generating applications out there now."If a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFFimage, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have todeal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?

I needed it for my bezier curve approximation routine.In some cases (generating offset curves) loops can occur. I now have afast method of detecting the generation of a curve with a loop. AlthoughI did not follow the article above strictly. The check if the fourth controlpoint lies in the the loop area, which is bounded by two parabolas andone ellips is too complicated. Instead I enlarged the loop-area andsurrounded it by for straight lines.

The author is not responsible for any         damage caused by this program.Important changes since version 1.30:    Fix bugs in file management system (file displaying).    Improve file management system (more user-friendly).    Fix bug in XPM version 3 reading.    Fix bugs in TARGA reading/writng.    Fix bug in GEM/IMG reading.    Add support for PCX and GEM/IMG writing.    Auto-skip macbinary header.(1) Introduction:  This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different  formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)  on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different  formts.  Include simple file management system.  Support 'slide show'.  There is NO LIMIT on image size.  Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.  If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).(2) Hardware Requirement:  PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.  min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).  (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).  Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.  Supported Wares:  * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)  * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping  * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768  * 80387  * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies  * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX  Unsupported:  * DPMI  * Microsoft Windows  Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory  model, SVGA graphics.(3) Installation:  Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.  (If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd)  (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible   with original version)+  *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with+      other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem,+      DON'T put go32.exe within search path.  *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.  If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment    GO32.  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256  If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387  **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.                 Other drivers are not tested.              2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits                 display. You don't need to use vesa driver.                 If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.              3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display,                 please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).

All Read/Write support full color(8 bits), grey scale, b/w dither,      and 24 bits image, if allowed for that format.(7) Detail:   Initialization:      Set default display type to highest display type.      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this      menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.+       The header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)".+         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use        for reading current file.      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This        program will automatically determine which format this file is.        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check        standard extension. Still fail, report error.      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key          (except ESCAPE).        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.        ESCAPE to terminate.      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.      Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.      pressing RETURN: show image.        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text        mode.      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).        True Color: save as 24-bit image.        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change        directory to what you want. Then,        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                      (filename under bar).  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,     the performance is poor.  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster       (No one is better for true 24bits image)  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested  8. This document is not well written.

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remotesensing techniques. 		   Intuitive Graphic Interface	Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing andanalysis simple and fast.	This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returningto the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.		    Image Format Compatibility	Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily openand save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or realdata values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formatsas well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.		    Image Analysis & Processing	For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes anassortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution product or principal component analyses.An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allowsthe user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively.Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trigonometric and transcendental functions.		    Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis	Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivityfor various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.).The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric andsurface conditions and instrument spectral bands.A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation,and 3-D image projection.		    Easy External Program Interfacing	Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externallydeveloped software algorithms for processing and converting satelliteobservations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parametersto external programs using special interface functions.		    Quick Quality Presentation	Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolutionmultispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 imageplanes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images,graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports.Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifyingand integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scaleoutput for standard inkjet and laser printers.	Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?		    Software Support & Development	 Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA) of the Universite de Lille, France.The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists atthe French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changingresearch needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which featureson-line help, is supported by an Internet address sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and version updates provided without delay.		    Performance Tested 	CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today,the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Centerand is widely used in many French laboratories, includingthe Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure ,Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique.   A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr   (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)   IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE. HOWEVER THE   VISUALISATION AND GRAPHIC FUNCTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS IS   SUFFICIENT TO WORK WITH.   IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KEEPING "SPHINX", SEND US YOUR EMAIL   AND YOU WILL RECEIVE NEWS ABOUT THE PACKAGE EVOLUTION.

[*]Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-codedfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slopeof 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried thisbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran apacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the "jaggies."  I'mnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distortthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise shearedshape?Currently I take:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64and produce:                         1  2  3  433 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  849 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                    61 62 63 64Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  Butit causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmapalready skewed?Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears tobe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outsideof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have tochange size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that thisapproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enoughdistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object ina real perspective drawing.Hopefully the "context" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torcheshanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.Thanks in advance for any help.-- Till next time,                \o/   \o/                                V \o/ V     email:pinky@tamu.edu<>  Sam  Inala  <>                 VFrom: besmith@uncc.edu (Brian E Smith)Subject: Re: Rayshade queryIn article 5742@sunvax.sun.ac.za, 8910782@sunvax.sun.ac.za () writes:>I am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces.

Gilardi)Subject: Need PostScript strokeadjust infoI need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature.This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed linelooks better on low resolution devices.The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  Theyalso give an example of how to "emulate" strokeadjust in PostScriptenvironments where it is absent.The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpointsof a line using the following formula for each coordinate:	new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25	Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in ".25".  Fromreading I thought that what they might actually do is:	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25	This results in all the coordinates ending in either "0.25" or "0.75" whichever is closer.By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find thatneither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPSresult looks better than how my stuff looks, I'd like to know ifanyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.Thanks,--Stevesqueegee@world.std.comFrom: news@magnus.acs.ohio-state.eduSubject: Package for Fashion Designer?This article was probably generated by a buggy news reader.From: gwang@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Ge Wang)Subject: Packages for Fashion Designers?Hello, I am looking for commercial software packages for professionalfashion designers.

Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association "Spectrum" offer       VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC/AT,wich include software and set of       controllers.                     SOFTWARE            For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed. Kit       includes more then 200 different functions for image processing.            Kit works in the interactive regime, and has include Help for       non professional users.            There are next possibility:       - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family;       - read - white image to - from disk;       - print image on the printer;       - makes arithmetic with 2 frames;       - filter image;       - work with gistogramme;       - edit image.       - include users exe modules.                     CONTROLLER VS9       The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.       VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from       a field of 724x600 pixels.       The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in       the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal       and vertical directions.       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.       Video signal capture time - 2.5s.                     CONTROLLER VS52       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was       created on the base of modern elements, including user       programmable gate arrays.       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning       devices).       The controller has the following technical characteristics:       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64       to 1024x512 pixels ;       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024       pixels;       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024       pixels ;       - number of gray level - 256 ;       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;       - 4 input video multiplexer ;       - input/output lookup table (LUT);       - possibility to realize "scroll" and "zoom";       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external       controlling signal) ;       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -       digital converter;       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the       controller by reprogramming it.              IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100            Image processor VS100 allows to digitize and process TV       signal in real time. It is possible digitize TV signal with       512*512*8 resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation       with two images.            Processor was created on the base of modern elements       including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board       for PC.            Memory volume allows write to the 256 frames with 512*512*8       format. It is possible to accumulate until 16 images.            The processor has the following technical characteristics:       - memory volume to 64 Mb;       - number of the gray level - 256;       - 4 input video multiplexer;       - input/output lookup table;       - electronic adjustment for black and white ADC reference;       - image size from 256*256 to 8192*8192;       - possibility color and black / white output;       - possibility input from slow-scan video sources.From: bates@spica.ucsb.edu (Andrew M.

I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years buthave never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have theopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to havesome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules toturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handlecomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simplepolygons). For example, in the letter "O" there are two outlines:	1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)	2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where thetwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a "polygon withholes". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interiorpolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.I do not want to use this simplistic system since:	1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple		matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for		some fancy fonts).	2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoiddecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (asis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidalpolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines intopolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solutionsince it creates excess number of polygons.Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to createbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on thesesubjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.Thanks for any pointers.--> Rob Lansdale-- Robert Lansdale - (416) 978-6619       Dynamic Graphics Project	Internet: lansd@dgp.toronto.edu        Computer Systems Research InstituteUUCP:   ..!uunet!dgp.toronto.edu!lansd University of TorontoBitnet:	  lansd@dgp.utoronto           Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, CANADAFrom: yoo@engr.ucf.edu (Hoi Yoo)Subject: looking for USA mapDoes anyone out there have or know of,  line drawing USA map?Thanks very much in advance,Hoiyoo@engr.ucf.eduFrom: doug@hparc0.aus.hp.com (Doug Parsons)Subject: 3D2 files - what are they?I was chaining around in the anonymous ftp world looking for 3D Studiomeshes and other interesting graphical stuff for the program, and founda few files with the extension 3D2.

But here's a brief summary...PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to manydevices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and takeadvantage of a 3D extension to X called "PEX".  PEXlib is a slightly"lower" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEXextension to X.Some advantages of using PEXlib...- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS- Provides immediate mode capabilities- Is free of "policy"- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.Some advantages of using PHIGS...- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things likearchiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find thatboth API's have a lot in common.Ralph MorMIT X ConsortiumFrom: tmc@spartan.ac.BrockU.CA (Tim Ciceran)Subject: Re: MPEG LocationAlan Jackson (ajackson@cch.coventry.ac.uk) wrote:: Can anyone tell me where to find a MPEG viewer (either DOS or: Windows).: Thanks in advance.: -- : Alan M.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was aversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results(for better or for worse).I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TVa while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence wherethe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitizeda portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating spacestation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement betweenframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigotcard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I thenimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaledto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default"2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every tenframes.I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I usedfor the results I'd been reporting earlier.Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first shorttest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external harddisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback ratewas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optionalscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster whoobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 inaction, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it'sentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with"preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they playedfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback wasvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps withease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add thismuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's taskswitching.A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't seeany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slightstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between thekey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will alsoimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performanceeven more...Lawrence D'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nzHamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47' 26" S, 175^ 19' 7" E, GMT+12:00From: stusoft@hardy.u.washington.edu (Stuart Denman)Subject: Easy to translate JPEG code...Does anyone out there have any JPEG decompression code in pretty much anylanguage that I can read and understand?

It makes more sense to see itas 65536 possible shades of pure red.This might actually make some sense, since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours) may produce visible 'jumps' in intensity.Then again, a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way of doing colour graphics, because it leaves ya such a tidy (and fast) programcode.

It does a much betterjob than the autotracing functions which are built into illustrationprograms. Of course, a higher resolution bitmap will produce a moreaccurate trace. The problem that I've run into though, is that when itcreates a detailed trace, it produces WAY more points than are necessary.If I trace something manually, I use many less es points.

The first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a pieceof a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get theoutline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneouslysuprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  Isuspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastlinevery irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The mostcommon mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel andtangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead ofthe coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactivealgorithm that would let you step in and say "no, dummy, you're going thewrong way".	Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did hisdoctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitizedmicrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve withits auto-trace tool.	In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since hewas trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding agood centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all futureanalysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problemsince the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what thevirus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could berestricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,clean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing reallife images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficultthis problem is to solve in the general case.	(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared whileon vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their lastknown location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.

Of course the chances ofOk It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few important parameters. The polygons are all convex. They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convexpolygons can be much more efficient than those that can drawconcave / self intersecting polygons. This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking forcode that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convexpolygons.  >finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess I'd need the source>with it.

There are otheralgorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementationsare included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).A variant method is described in "Graphics Gems", p. 287-293.  Note thatthe code from the "Graphics Gems" series is all available from an FTP site,as described above.Check out John Bradley's "Diversity Algorithm", which is incorporated intothe xv package and described in the back of the manual.The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains anotherquantizing algorithm which is presented as "doing a better job than theother algorithms, but slower".There's also an implementation of:Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional DataClustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988),pp. 153-162.avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code,in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.4) Converting color into grayscale.The NTSC formula is:    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.The only reference you need for this stuff is:    Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulationsoftware mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can dosome form of gray to b&w conversion.6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the sourceimage, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doingsub-pixel sampling.However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originallycreated for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation isalso present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: "A Fast Algorithm for RasterRotation", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) GraphicsInterface '86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears inthe same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appearsin "Graphics Gems" (see section [1]) under the original title.7) Free image manipulation software.There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format toanother, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plusthe above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.Here are pointers to some of them:    xv by John Bradley.

There are a number of automated mail servers that willsend you things like this in response to a message.  See item 13 below fordetails on some.Also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussionof software like this.  You may find useful information there.8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.You almost certainly don't need these.  Read the above item 7 on freeimage manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages andlook through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter youwere going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of theformat documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp fromzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional objectformats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as MarkHall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintainedby Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists atftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,neither of these is complete, you might want to check both.FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format mostoften used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only imagesbut other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics andinformation posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.9) Converting between vector formats.A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDrawto CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a verydifferent problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Convertingone image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once youget past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objectsare the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filledround-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to doa one-to-one conversion between vector formats.There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  Thecontributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of suchconverters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have beenposted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archivesite.A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector formatto a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL toX11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones forPC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs canbe used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, theanswer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector tovector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would betrivial.GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includesdrivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used asa PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implementsessentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScriptand level 2).10) How to get Pixar films.The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are availableon video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:    Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price    Luxo, Jr.				$14.95			$50.00    Red's Dream				$19.95			$75.00    Tin Toy				$24.95			$75.00    Knickknack				$24.95			$75.00    Luxo, Jr./Red's Dream/Tin Toy	$39.95			$100.00All tapes are on 1/2" VHS NTSC.

Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international,213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verifyprices and availability.  Or, just write to:    Direct Cinema Limited    1749 14th Street    Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342Allan Braunsdorf has this to say:At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shortsfor $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightlymore than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it'savailable from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address).    Pixar    1001 West Cutting Blvd.    Richmond, CA. 94804    (510) 236-4000     (510) 236-0388 (FAX)You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains "Luxo, Jr.", "Red'sDream", "Tin Toy" and "Knicknack" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. Theywill take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the licenseagreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?The short answer is, "You can't."  Unless you use a rational spline youcan only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable,but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error ofapproximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were notvisible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want todo the job right, consult the article:  "A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles"  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,  September, 1989, pages 48-56.For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:  "Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves"  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]12) How to order standards documents.The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and alsoISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have thecomplete name and number.Some useful numbers to know:CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (GraphicalKernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer's HierarchicalInteractive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSIY14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicitcomments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can letyou know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineeringat 1-800-854-7179.13) How to FTP by email.There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroupsand make them available via an email query system.  You send a messageto an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm",and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail toftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying "help" and it will tell you how to useit.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing toinfinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number ofedges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interiorhole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known inthe trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article inGlassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, includingtreatment of special cases.Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to allthe vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about anorder of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating thetrigonometric functions is usually quite costly.Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found inthe Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.15) How to tessellate a sphere.One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  Thebase of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divideseach triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:Highlights of this edition-    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through       November '91;    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91;    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long.Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named"speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z" and is compressed at most sites-             Site                             Dir	wuarchive.wustl.edu	graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/	karazm.math.uh.edu	pub/Graphics/	gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/	nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/graphics	coral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/globalillumination bibliographies.  These are in "refer" format, and so can besearched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords isincluded with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of thesites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained atprinceton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as "RayBib.*" and "RadBib.*".Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from raytracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentiallyin plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  Thiscollection is available at most of the sites above as "rtabs.*".17) SIGGRAPH information online[from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org(128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via bothanonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includesboth conference and publications subdirectories.To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to     archive-server@siggraph.organd in the subject or the body of the message include the message  sendfollowed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is withthe command     send indexwhich will give you an up-to-date list of available information.18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available[from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedingsat the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are availablein three formats:     text   (ASCII)     rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)     word   (MS Word for the Macintosh)They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:(1) by anonymous ftp    change to one of the directories       publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]    The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word    files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary     mode.    Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the    contents of each panel file.(2) by electronic mail    send mail to       archive-server@siggraph.org    You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you    first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages       send panel91-txt index       send panel91-rtf index    in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary    information to retrieve the actual transcript files.19) Graphics mailing listsThere are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, eachcovering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been anactive participant in one of these for some time now, and find thefocus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topicto be nothing short of amazing.Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others youwould like to see added.Name:		Imagine mailing listDescription:	Discussion forum for users of the Imagine 3D Rendering and		Animation package by Impulse, Inc.Platforms:	Amiga, IBMSubscription:	imagine-request@email.sp.paramax.comPosting:	imagine@email.sp.paramax.comName:		DCTV mailing listDescription:	Discussion forum for users of the Digital Creations DCTV		box, software, and file formatsPlatforms:	AmigaSubscription:	DCTV-request@nova.cc.purdue.eduPosting:	DCTV@nova.cc.purdue.eduName:		Rayshade Users mailing listDescription:	Discussion forum for users of the Rayshade raytracerPlatforms:	Most UNIX boxes, Amiga, Mac, IBMSubscription:	rayshade-request@cs.princeton.eduPosting:	rayshade-users@cs.princeton.eduName:		Lightwave 3D software for Toaster mailing listDescription:	Discussion forum for users of Lightwave, the Video		Toaster modelling and rendering packagePlatforms:	AmigaSubscription:	lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com		with "subscribe lightwave-l" in your messagePosting:	lightwave@bobsbox.rent.comName:		POV mailing listDescription:	Discussion forum for DKBTrace and POV renderersPlatforms:	UnixSubscription:	listserv@trearn.bitnetPosting:	dkb-l@trearn.bitnetName:		Mailing List For Massive Parallel RenderingDescription:	same?Platforms:	UnixSubscription:	mp-render-request@icase.eduPosting:	mp-render@icase.edu20) Specific references on file formats    Graphics File Formats, David Kay and John Levine, Windcrest/McGraw-Hill      1992, ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 paper, ISBN 0-8306-3060-0 $36.95 hardcover,      ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 $24.95 paper.

Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.21) What about GIF?GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upona wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, thekeeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't likeit much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Questionwhich was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a listof newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General infoSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific infoNewsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,	alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,	alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answersAvailable in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp frompit-manager.mit.edu in the files:/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mailmessage containing any or all of:send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2Send a message containing "help" to get general information about themail server.Also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and20 above for more information.22) What is morphing?Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a newlocation. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping andmorphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.auin the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer anduncompress them afterwards.23) How to ray-trace height fieldsHeight fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, theyget their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt belocated via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:F.

The . represents the dot product operator and the xrepresents the cross product operator.  Sigma represents the summationoperator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equalto P0.25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPHProbably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to yourlocal technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM.Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank.Fill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00,Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 forVoting or Associate Members (also yearly).

I need help finding a companythat will take photographic images scanned in and modified by Adobe Photoshopand turn them into thermal prints or negatives.  I am looking for a placeas close to North Carolina as possible.  The images will be created ona Macintosh Quadra 800 running Adobe Photoshop and will then be stored inwhatever format the vendor requires, perhaps 88M cartridges?    The images will be black and white photographs scanned in with a 1200 dpiscanner then modified/corrected by Adobe Photoshop.  If anyone could help meor even give me phone numbers to people who could I would be very grateful.    Also if anyone else is doing what I am planning I would be happy to hearfrom you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system youuse and/or any peripherals or software.  It seemed the Quadra 800 would bemy best bet to modify photographic images.  I am planning on buying a Quadra800 with 32Megs of RAM, a 510Meg Hard Drive, a 1200 dpi scanner, 17" Sony monitor and a 88Meg cartridge drive and perhaps a CD ROM.

Light rays are calculated (L1 to Ln where n is the number of light sources) - these being the lightrays that do not intersect with anything. The reflected ray (R) andthe transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its owncolour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n).The question is:   How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCol's to get  the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray?All colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b componentsbetween 0 and 1.If anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints?--Adrian Secchiaasecchia@cs.uct.ac.zaFrom: doug@hparc0.aus.hp.com (Doug Parsons)Subject: Re: 48-bit graphics...Apollo (now HP) have a graphics board that does 80-bit graphics.

The exhibition presents the untold story of the VaticanLibrary as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence ofRome as a political and scholarly superpower during theRenaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the JeffersonBuilding of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 throughApril 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available byanonymous FTP indefinitely.     The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The VaticanLibrary, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine &Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Cameto Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Eachsection consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibitdirectory and contains the exhibit text for that section andseparate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibitincludes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit,but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used ifthere were a problem with one of the primary objects) and itemsomitted later in the planning process.     This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissancescholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians ofscience or medicine, early music scholars, students of thehumanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, andto librarians and information professionals.

I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channelof 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits torepresent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d pictureto be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previousframe) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.>(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.Mind you the card costs more than your workstation.--Chris Lilley----------------------------------------------------------------------------Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training ProjectComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

How this could be done in practice ?I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure theirnormals pointing outside the polyhedra ?

People seem perfectly capable	dealing with these others.  Dealing with the format of TIFF	is frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT, LZW, and	FAX encoding of the image data.  The majority of the libraries	which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather	than with simply decoding the tags and parameters.	Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather	simpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest	that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.	That doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine, but don't even thing about	using it in many instances.  GIF is very nice for use in low-end	photos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would	never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems.  FAX is nice,	but it doesn't do color (and GIF doesn't do B&W all that well).	JPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end.	The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle	all these situations (and then some).  Naturally it's more complex.	But I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging	systems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday.	You may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes	but please don't wrail against it's complexity.  The complexity	it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and	doesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially	viable file formats.	If we're in philosophical arguments against complexity, let's all	go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length	encoding.Subject: DXF to PCX,GIF,TIF or TGA?From: murashiea@mail.beckman.com (Ed Murashie)Does anyone know of a program for the PC thatwill take AutoCad DXF format files and convertthem to a raster format, like PCX, GIF, etc?Thanks in advance....

The reflected| ray (R) and the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.| | Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours | along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its own| colour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n).| | The question is: |   How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCol's to get|   the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray?    First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused aboutthis issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggestthat the weakness is your reference material.  Get "An Introduction to RayTracing" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracingalgorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding upall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  Forexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding upand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lowerbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, youget some illumination equation like this:        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the lightintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly lesshand-waving illumination equation is this:        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by thematerial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get fromtransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for apurple-colored glass object.    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my "illuminationequation sermon" to you also.______________________________________________________________________________Steve Hollasch                                   Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc.hollasch@kpc.com                                 Santa Clara, CaliforniaFrom: hollasch@kpc.com (Steve Hollasch)Subject: Re: What is the difference between Raytracing and rendering?zlg1409@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Zhenhai Li ) writes:| Hello, I've raytraced and rendered and the only difference I've found | is that raytracing takes a hell of a lot longer.

Computer  graphics has played  adecisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists tobuild, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects. While computer scientists are conversant in the language of theirown discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigmsand technological advances in graphical computing. This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gapbetween computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistryresearchers who wish to be more than just casual users ofprepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended tobe a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data setsfrom chemical research problems will be used in lab and studentswill be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercisesand projects will be carried out using data-flow programming(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will haveaccess to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including videorecording equipment.

Notes========(Excerpted from the FAQ article)Please do *not* post or mail messages saying "I can't FTP, couldsomeone mail this to me?"  There are a number of automated mail serversthat will send you things like this in response to a message.There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroupsand make them available via an email query system.  You send a messageto an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm",and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.==========================================================================3.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display==========================================================PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)======================IMDISP------  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions  [PC and Macs]LabVIEW 2---------  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the  "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual  instrument.  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has  utility functions for memory management data communications and  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for  the development of custom code.)Ultimage Concept VI-------------------  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and  characterization.  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can  be imported.  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom  modules.  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even  hole filling.  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494  707-579-1733IPLab Spectrum--------------  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a  movie command for cycling through windows.Macintosh-based tools=====================NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more---------------------------------  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been  developed by Spyglass.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..

Several steps are often required to  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a  variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close  hues, color range and mask.ImageStudio: Don't know...

One such feature allows the user to  select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide  selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109Image Analyst-------------  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in  radiographs.  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or  a disk-stored image.  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu  (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)  Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,  VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and  can do image arithmetic, etc.    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.     There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and  Australia to name a few. LABOimage---------  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.

Feature Description  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of  modules.  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and  ratioing.  Host Configuration Requirements  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific  applications programs.  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be  interactively driven through this control.  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be  added to further enhance referenced imagery.  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional  processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically  and carefree.  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that  difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display"HIPS----(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well  as a huge user-contributed library.  Feature description  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users  become effective using HIPS on their first day.  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual  pages, and on-line documentation.  Host Configuration Requirements  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.  Availability  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other   palettes can be generated.Supported functions include such niceties as the following:o  image & image: + - / * interpolationo  image & constant: + - / *o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles========================================= First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTPlist above.24-bit scanning:----------------  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll  house supplies.  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.Books with textures:--------------------  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also  a wide variety of stock art is available.  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your  graphics work. Their address is:	Edition Belvedere Co.

Introduction to rendering algorithms========================================a. Ray-Tracing:---------------  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would  suggest:   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines  (erich@eye.com)There's a more concise reference also:  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in  "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)--------------------------A good reference is:        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.c. Others:----------???[ More info is needed -- nfotis ]========================================================================15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:================================================a. Teapot ?-----------"Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the wholestory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also hasthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframemodel of the teapot.IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column "Jim Blinn's Corner" describesan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations forexample are used.The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to getthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles ata specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs atessellation at any specified resolution.b. Space Shuttle ?------------------Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttledatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):model1:A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).Payload doors non-existent.Units: unknown.Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy.

Image annotation software=============================a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a  rasterfile.b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not  sure exactly what they are.  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not  be redistributed without permission.  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the   position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen   color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest  X11 archive.========================================================================17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers  (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports  Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a  freebie if you want it"  "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets   comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,   menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability   of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an   encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap   manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only   color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets   developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget   set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)===================================================GRASS-----  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,  although it is reported to have significant image processing  capabilities.  Feature Descriptions  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68  Host Configuration Requirements  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented  in raster (grid-cell) form.  Availability  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.  This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and  "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu  Support  Listserv mailing lists:  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.  Feature Description  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available  for GIS applications.  Host Configuration Requirements  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.PCI---  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of  remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.  The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI  database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.  "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your  particular application/interest calls for.  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from  a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default  directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI  data structures (database file, parameter file).  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the  Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different  "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the  graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to  contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this  can go into the PCI "database").  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would  display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"  in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these  areas.SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)--------------------------------  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X  for display.MAP II------  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.CLRview-------  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

E-mail replies to			Dave Small			dts@cis.ufl.eduFrom: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com (David Gorgen)Subject: Need help: Z-buffering lines & areas togetherI'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably lowapparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 differentPEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in anyresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually thesame article with a test program demonstrating the problem oncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs andare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program incomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approachto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the aboveGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize "stitching"artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that arecoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line willdiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z valuesacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident withvertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether theZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though theline is supposed to be solid.Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightlydifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, onefor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always ineffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  Theresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as toattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes usedin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair "backwards" (i.e.smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the viewtable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformedto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line thanif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amountto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRCbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fixthe stitching.But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Zcomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears moreor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of theZ-buffer have any dependable meaning!

(2) What to do about it?        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision            in Z-buffered HLHSR?        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching            artifacts?        --  Am I just out of luck?Any help would be immensely appreciated!-- ===============================================================================Dave Gorgen                         Internet: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.comApplicon Inc.                                 gorgen@aaaca1.sinet.slb.comAnn Arbor, Michigan (USA)               UUCP: ...!uunet!sharkey!applga!gorgenFrom: ewinterr@cwis.isu.edu (EWING_TERRY)Subject: Raytriacing and animationNow I have a couple raytracing questions.Just so you know I'm using PovRay 1.0 (both MS-dos and Unix) and I'm generating Targa files of varying size.1) ok, so I can view these wonderful pictures on my screen.

I'm notmathematically literate (ie. I don't have a degree in mathematics), soany material that is suggested I would prefer that it was notmathematically intensive.The best book I have found on the subject at the moment is:"Practical Digital Image Processing"by Rhys LewisISBN: 0-13-683525-2Published by Ellis Horwood (c)1990.Likewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrateImage Processing techniques. So far I have 'xv', and 'khoros' for Unix.'Dcview 2.1' for the IBM PC, and various related smatterings of C codeto help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancementvia convolution etc.If anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain softwarepertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where I ammost likely to find it on the AARNET (Internet). If I can I would prefersource code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processingcode/algorithms, that I can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes ofdemonstration it would be most helpful.All the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies,and will be liberally used in my paper, and seminar on the subject.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than   realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results   (for better or for worse).   I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized   a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default   "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten   frames.   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used   for the results I'd been reporting earlier.   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.   That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in   action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with   "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with   ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task   switching.   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance   even more...

Image sizeis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can alsomake a real difference.Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...-Peter Lee --/-------------------- Peter E.

Interchange Format and was put forth byCompuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could beread and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but hasa built in compression scheme (LZW?).IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to packageimages, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF wascreated by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga.It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga.The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeavedBitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp atzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats(Taken from the FAQ for this news group.)  :)Wayne Rigbyrigby@cs.unr.eduFrom: bkidd@esk.compserv.utas.edu.au ( Byron John Kidd)Subject: POV 286 ??

I needa mapping icon per applied texture.  I want to use a special purposegraphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texturerule/plane to be specified in 3Space, i.e. position/orientation of themapping rule.  Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to applytextures to ALL objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3DS totallyunsuitable for my needs.Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for aPC?

Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support forthe VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such asthe Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picturequality if your dithering works right).I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's toGIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGAcard and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to writesome programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and othercolour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinbergdithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palettethe resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally wouldwhen viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering butit does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my waygives a brighter more detailed image.Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, asfar as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than theVGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)Have a day!Gerry.From: larry@ducktales.med.ge.com (Larry Landwehr)Subject: Corel Draw or Harvard Draw?My wife wants to publish a newsletter.

I'musing Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens betweenthe key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form(x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y andz component of the viewing direction vector of the camera whenpositioned at (x,y,z).The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with thepositions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I'vetried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to thechord between the two adjacent view points (which in general arenot key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of theviewing direction vector at the key frame positions (althoughthe spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain- I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementationerror...)Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form forsimilar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.I'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at  iharkest@lise.unit.noAnyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary ofthe replies if they contact me.--  _________     __________________\\        \\  \\ \\ N G E  \\==\\ A R K E S T A D     iharkest@lise.unit.no         Comp.

I was alsoshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills byabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  Whatis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, duemainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but ismore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end atdifferent x/y values, the "ridges" are out of phase, resulting in thestitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygonright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely seea smeared effect where they overlap.  Example:  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick whenrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaceswith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, asyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, thesystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so theapplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.Bravo!(Note to IBM'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosedthrough proper channels so I'm not giving away any new unpublished info.)--   Mark Einkauf     [ einkauf@austin.ibm.com ]  IBM - Advanced Workstations and Systems - Graphics Systems  Austin TX * Views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of IBM Corp. *From: s127@ii.uib.no (Torgeir Veimo)Subject: virtual soundI'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do isthe following;From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each havingit's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given thelisteners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of thelisteners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  Thismeans that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it'sincoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this ispossible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several anglesrelative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a givenangle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from thesource.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound sourcechanges position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally somereflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is definedcould be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandationsimulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system?

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video standards.        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed offered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is also offering this card in the "TurboBahn" combination packaged with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance value.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to "turbocharge" the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced chip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins are available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for IBM-compatible personal computers.

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the application.  It may let you- manipulate application data, the camera,  3-D objects in the scene and so on, or- view the status of the application or 3-D objects  via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or- do whatever I missed but you think is possible.For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as apartially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The lengthof the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on theruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation andfeedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance betweenthe objects along its own axis.Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.

The conference was organized by the Rensse-          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS          users  to  "take  charge of your PHIGS" by participating in PHIGS          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  "beyond          PHIGS".          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools          based on PHIGS.          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.          PHIGS EVERYWHERE          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to          mainframes.          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing          and translucency.          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.          Radiosity support is also planned.          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful          "2-call"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or          Starbase.          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS          or ARENA is available on request.          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most          workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-          porates PEX support.          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the          DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.          DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with          support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most          GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and          the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.

Brown Associates.------Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphicssubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products usea parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Bothhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array ofpixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantlyin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and marketpenetration.There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC andE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-enddeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential andflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two tosixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends ata higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedomsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors thatsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedomdesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowingdevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purposeapplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput andvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Notethat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will notrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,however, will remain much more flexible.The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-endFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream pricepoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome becauseit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resultingin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products providestrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized thatnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali'sconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchasegeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgradethem separately as needed.Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping atworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensiveVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to providethis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolationof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higherqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denaliprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelismfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphicsdata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformationmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levelsto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linkingtexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalablesolution.Hope this helps,BrianPS This was reprinted without permission.

I have had>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help? Certainly. Reference follows. Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be calledred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or majordysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to longwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination andalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although itcan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computergraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colourdeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from thispoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far redcorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightlydifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimentalsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and oneaffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder ontowhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm onthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line isvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia orduuteranopia:1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line4) This is the new chromaticity. The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colourdefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics andApplications 8(5) 28-40.You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are notfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow>previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the redgreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, andthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, orobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities acouple of weeks ago.The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be ahelp here.)A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once youhave the monitor data.B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 aboveD) find the intersection as in step 3E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step AF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move italong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black andwhite) until it is displayable.>Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is>sufficient interestDone; also posted for the rest of us.--Chris Lilley----------------------------------------------------------------------------Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training ProjectComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. Thiscolour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply thesemodifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mappedto this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry toeach colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smoothcolour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending howfar each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would lookrather odd.So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and>>much more complicated.>>If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much>>more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. Ifthat was not what you meant, then:>(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many>places so far.)Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your postingmade it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorryif I misunderstood.>You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV.

The problems you present are exist anyway,and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make suchproblems to my programs in the first place.Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit imageas I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized imageback to 24 bit image.>>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How>>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global>>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and>>>much more complicated.Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bitand user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,jumps off the discussion a bit.My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bitimage -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:changing individual colors in colormap is useless in mostcases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change maymake serious errors to anywhere in the image.XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with thementioned type images.Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those globalchanges. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds likepaint program job.If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get theoriginal 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bitimage, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible tomodify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (ifimage is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --selecting individual color is possible from that.Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seensuch in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention24bit painting program in 8bit screen...>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is notdesigned for that.Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it isexpected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designedwithout thinking about human interface and how human expect theprogram work -- design error.I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, butit were not good idea to take full 24bit images without makingmajor change to the original design.So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and savedimages could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goesup, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.(Americans: the lift is just an example :)Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded toread it.Juhana KouhiaFrom: ricky@vnet.ibm.com (Rick Turner)Subject: Re: raw2gif ?You can use PBM's 'rawtopgm' to convert three raw (r, g, b) files to pgm format.

People seem perfectly capable>dealing with these others.Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encoderectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear thatit is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 usefuloptions, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is thatrather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistentlyin all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers onall machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be preparedto do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --again, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be storedby pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I alsonote that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliablycompresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting thatnone of the FAX formats are really useful.What's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would haveprovided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compressesbytes rather than pixels.But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can registerproprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliablyread all incoming TIFF files.

What's sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how muchit has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor'shardware.  I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple,DEC, and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor'shardware.  Currently, it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI aboutdropping support for the Personal Iris, DEC customers are pissed at DEC fordropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes, and Apple customersseem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that's faster andcheaper than the one they just bought.  When I used to be a Sun customeryears ago, I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386and 680x0 customers out in the cold when Sparc came along.

While Iwas working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little,which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer andall peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.I left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen wascompletely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider stillworked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out whatwas on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I stilltried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc.,all to no avail.Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that Ineed to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the"death" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventuallyhappened.  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on thenet about this because I already know what they'll say: "Yep, you gotta havethis replaced and it's gonna cost you $???."I've only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable lifecycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: thebrand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz.I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it downbefore coming in to work today.If anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I'm notopposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutelynecessary.

You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising),manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying thesechanges to the 24 bit file when you exit xv.

First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you aresaying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use thoseparts of the program that cause the problem!!>Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global>changes.

You don't seemto have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to thenext. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this onethrough.>>Yes again.

You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehowreverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been madeto the 8 bit image palette.Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?>say,>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is>expected that the image still is the same. Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the maincontrol panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bitimage. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bitfile. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.>So, XV were designed>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the>program work -- design error.Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It letsyou import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about thehuman interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose itwas designed for. It makes no false claims.>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making>major change to the original design.If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description ofprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them.

Zhao)Subject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.   The following is the relevant sections from the man page.    -----------------------------------------------------------------Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)NAME   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI WorkstationsDESCRIPTION  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically  giving great flexibility in processing an image.FEATURES  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete,   the processed image will be displayed.  Current features include  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing    and filling the "rotated out" region with an arbitrary color.  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with    the option of subpixel sampling.  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as    in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-    lability of graphical histograms of the image.  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a    circle).  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.  o Performs histogram equalization.  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of    arbitrary order.  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.  o Cuts and pastes across images.  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause    interval between images. (SlideShow)  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.  o Performs image type conversions.  o Converts image formats.  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image    back and display it.  o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the    resulting power spectra.  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).

The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!For example:	SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same	thing, a 127% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the	annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite,	which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the	proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.	TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.	Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI	membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings,	these are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic	rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost.	SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the	Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to	be included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG	also has doubled its membership fee.What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months agotouting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make itsound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple,like SIGGRAPH, all the "plus" services appear to be just splitting the costsinto smaller piles so that they don't look so big.  But their recommendedchanges to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31%increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31%inflation rate on the publications I got last year.Is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am?________________________________________________________________________________Robert Reed			Home Animation Ltd.		503-656-8414robert@slipknot.rain.com	5686 First Court, West Linn, OR 97068SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMSMotif:  You spend days writing a UIL description of your foot, the  trajectory, the bullet, and the intricate scrollwork on the ivory handles  of the gun.

In a recentissue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  Itsaid:  "There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computerindustry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90's."  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the "cracker" ethic, which is somethingentirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value thefree distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why isit that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able tohave a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a personlike myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given anyuseful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completelyignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts tomake truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselveshackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a factthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do sofor a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in avolume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smallerthan it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if thecorporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.    That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off ofinnovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaudit; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreativesystems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are theproblem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up forblunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,where?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves "hackers"allowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on thecomputer industry?

Once you have a gopher client point it at merlot.welch.jhu.edu and welcome to gopher-space!Dan Jacobsondanj@welchgate.welch.jhu.edu-----Common Questions and Answers about the Internet Gopher, aclient/server protocol for making a world wide information service,with many implementations.  Posted to comp.infosystems.gopher, comp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks.The most recent version of this FAQ can be gotten through gopher, orvia anonymous ftp:rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faqThose without FTP access should send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.eduwith "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body to find outhow to do FTP by e-mail.------------------------------------------------------------------- List of questions in the Gopher FAQ:Q0:  What is Gopher?Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher?Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?Q7: What is veronica?Q8: What is Available for Biology?-------------------------------------------------------------------Q0:  What is Gopher?A0:  The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed     information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide     information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed.   While     providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher     facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers     throughout the world. -------------------------------------------------------------------Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?A1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory     /pub/gopher--------------------------------------------------------------------Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?A2:  You will need a gopher "client" program that runs on your local PC     or workstation     There are clients for the following systems.  The directory     following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous     ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory     /pub/gopher.

A Microsoft Windows Winsock client "The Gopher Book"        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip      A Macintosh Application, "MacGopher".        ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh *      Another Macintosh application, "GopherApp".        ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp *      A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP        oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe      A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS     	 bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe      A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell's LAN Workplace      for DOS         lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX         job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE     * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP.     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client     itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:       Type=1       Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu       Port=70       Path=       Name=Gopher Software Distribution.      Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and     look in the gopher directory.     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine     "consultant.micro.umn.edu" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more     information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.---------------------------------------------------------------------Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize     network lag.     Telnet Public Logins:     Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------     consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4	gopher  North America     gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America     panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201	panda   North America     gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe     info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia     gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden     tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America     ecnet.ec		           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.---------------------------------------------------------------------Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help     our campus find answers to their computer questions.       It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information     System used by a large number of sites in the world.     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to     count.      The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:         Internet Gopher Developers      100 Union St. SE #190      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA     Or via FAX at:       +1 (612) 625-6817---------------------------------------------------------------------Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to:             - Search local WAIS indices.       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher         clients.       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher         clients.       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.-------------------------------------------------------------------Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :     _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note:                             ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!)     _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World Online"     By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

As archie is to ftp archives, veronica      is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the     gopher protocol.     To try veronica, select it from the "Other Gophers" menu on      Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace)      Type=1      Port=70      Path=1/veronica      Host=futique.scs.unr.edu------------------------------------------------------------------------------Q8: What is Available for Biology?A8: There is an incredible amount of software, data and information    availble to biologists now by gopher.Here is a brief list of the Biological Databases that you can search via gopher:      2.

Hacking iswhat AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g.thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly,etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources thatnot many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producingrunning programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches toproblem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas -and I have to say I'm inclined to agree.(I don't claim to be a superhacker, but I don't think that invalidates my remarks.And I'm sure this isn't the whole story.)--Peter Jackson, Dept of Electrical & Computer Eng, Clarkson University"Opinions expressed are not those of my employer or any other organization"Second Violin, Fiddling Firefighters Ensemble (Rome Branch)From: mac@utkvx.bitnet (Richard J.

I remember the great computer fallout of the earlyeighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systemsthat were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widelydivergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn newsystems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program wasneeded we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as acommercial offering was just not available.

JPEG is designed for compressing eitherfull-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or linedrawings.JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does ithandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those typesof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEGrespectively.JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn'tquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves muchof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notablythe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small detailsof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, thesmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they areinvisible to the eye.A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied byadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* smallfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing imagearchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if youaren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, youcan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.[2]  Why use JPEG?There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files acrossnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference indisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have toconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Evenwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG imagethan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, usingJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order tostore or transmit an image more cheaply.It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, thetime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than theextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenetposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete asblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailedin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images amongpeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the firstthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color orgray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs andsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixelsthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeedby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but theyshould be avoided in JPEG files.)JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixelsadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, thissort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairlyoften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness isparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall betweenscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex andsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scaleimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale imagesof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether youshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, onlyapplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start froma GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEGcan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I havehandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first threefiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B.File	   Size in bytes		Commentsship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25			 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were			 of poorer image quality than this.ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smallerthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as theGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff byselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of theinformation", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;it's not a percentage of anything.The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable fromthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from oneobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except forexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce afile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able togo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, youmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and areprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 isabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you canget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTPList FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq inthe news.answers archive.NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couplemonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.[6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on onekind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check outthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that thislist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain overInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.X Windows:XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many otherimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple imagemanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with supportfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand newand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleedingedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note thatversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll getonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 worksfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is aglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkboxwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  TheImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormappeddisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or thebasic free JPEG software.Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latestrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the currentxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are saidto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.MS-DOS:This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface isnot flashy, but it's functional.Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  Thecurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPUand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows andOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fiton the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that itslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is abit tricky; read the directions carefully!A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface isalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger thanscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and bothare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zipor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-inVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complainsthat the driver is missing.)A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking aroundthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortlyand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latestrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality ispoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of theseviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programsto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If youhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try tofind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.)The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (orjpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOScompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they willconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; inparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The majoradvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietaryJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it isnot readable on non-PC platforms.Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulationpackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programsis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this documentrefers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you shouldexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are severalInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USAmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 filesin (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you canretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings incomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.Microsoft Windows:There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversionprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frillsviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while itdecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out thedecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEGfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other usefulfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it'san excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available fromftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment andslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirrorsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,which is roughly 25% faster.)ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promisingcontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point ithas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, thecurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, filepub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version willbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screenmode, not in a window.OS/2:The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderatoris not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4./pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.

GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.Macintosh:Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part ofthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be runningSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also installthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can getQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster andconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, isnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 fordetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing imagesthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also canconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a bigimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 andQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best colorimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView canview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it'sthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on atypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it downto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most otherviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some peoplelike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is verywell thought out.GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF andPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latestversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, butit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversioncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot ofplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter canload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet ifyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, tryconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, isavailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIFconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using thisprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, andGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixiefrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it'sreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it producesrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is anunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does notintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, calledPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trashit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a muchcleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note thatPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, butit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it onolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can'tuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of adownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If youdon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although notall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEGplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloadedJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.Amiga:(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive atamiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of thisarchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a goodchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being ageneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can readseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo versionis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images largerthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, evencapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  Thecurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirrorsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory issupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run underAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packagesthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, andImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both aredistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulationsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is anotherwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas fromamiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, fileAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, manybased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanksto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, withoutso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG","VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk spaceit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.Atari ST:The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-levelgrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Availablefrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers forAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.Acorn Archimedes:!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and viewJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handleJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can befound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available byregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/writefunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other imageformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but notnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.Portable software for almost any system:If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the freeJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have adisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targaor PPM 24-bit image files.There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up everyday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you findthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whetherthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it canhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases arenot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the IndependentJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current releaseis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget toretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you mayprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available onCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearestcomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQarticle "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and imagefiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in otherprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we havetested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement inproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as withanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like tocontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, thecomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representativecolors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is somethingof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck withthe standard usage though.)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for mostimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impacton the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except atthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for displayon 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, whatcomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a littledifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probablycome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required todisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the imagesource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk aboutthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to countthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give youdifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally seeposted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), butnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in itspalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that thesender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender'squantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors thanwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorerimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantizationalgorithm, you're out of luck.For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image qualityfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's displayhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of futureimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research inthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEGimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what wassent.It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rathershoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGAdisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than youneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two colorquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it'salso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to usehigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and innormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to bedisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the averageGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit displayhardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays onworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is alreadyobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of theirdisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing imagesin a machine-independent fashion.[8]  How does JPEG work?The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosinetransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropycoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee diddefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees thefinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, thislossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEGalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very fewimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficientquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEGalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors invarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixelvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhapshalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEGprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guaranteesbit-for-bit accuracy.If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with lessthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into theJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with aHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee wasprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the internationalstandards organizations.Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree ona common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence ofofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible withanybody else's.The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some workthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have definedtwo JPEG-based file formats:  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports    pixels and not much else.  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the    mix will do anything to improve this situation.Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendorsof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercialproducts will adhere to one or both standards.I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF inpicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; theTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is stillunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is welldefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest commondenominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTimesoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF andQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs areavailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editorthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIFby hand; see section 11 for details.Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF andImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-formatfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likelyto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),    try stripping off everything before that.In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is	"begin" line	M_]C_X ...whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with	"begin" line	M:'-I ...If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble ofdownloading non-JFIF files.[12]  What about arithmetic coding?The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final outputof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usuallyproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by theJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licensesfrom these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implementand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubiousat best.)At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry aboutarithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify thepotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in thefuture.  Stay tuned for further details.[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you coulddecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress itwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an alteredimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost thefirst time around.The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompressit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get anidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventuallydegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generationoutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error canbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be thatcompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the originalquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, butthat's a mighty limited capability!)The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage andtransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediateformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you areready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if youconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the originalfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG fromthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimumloss of quality.The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, tomake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher qualitysetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained insection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colorsdon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the bestcandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offerthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don'texpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those createddirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may haveto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-throughJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-colorborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharpborder boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windowssystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painlessway to do this.)cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, butfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoidimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higherQ setting may not be necessary.)Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to foolyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often ofsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixelstogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  Thetrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequencycolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEGfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would havegotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color thatyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapidcolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing willoften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size ofthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output imagethan you'd get without smoothing.With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothingcapability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handeddithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regularfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strongsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blurthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processingwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such aspnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother isa LOT faster than pnmconvol...The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably agood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about theimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.---------------------For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software inparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.-- 			tom lane			organizer, Independent JPEG GroupInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu	BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegieFrom: grady@netcom.com (1016/2EF221)Subject: Re: Where did the hacker ethic go?Kendall 'Opusii' Sears (krsear02@ulkyvx.louisville.edu) wrote:: : or the biggest killer (IMO): :    6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's:       version of reality.

ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts Plug and Play on every PC.The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-platform use of the same device.ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:=====================================ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without fee or royalty.ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.ACCESS.bus Physical Layer^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware protocol, with one data line and one clock line.Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock synchronization.  ACCESS.bus Software Protocols^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the receiver.  BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with additional semantics, including checksum.Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the system is running, without rebooting.APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: keyboards, locators, and text devices.ACCESS.bus support on the PC^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples of the interface from applications to the device drivers.To Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):------------------------------------------------Postal Address:370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086Internet Email:  abig@netcom.comFax: (408) 991-3773Voice: (408) 991-3517From: Matjaz.Gams@IJS.siSubject: ``Call for Papers for INFORMATIKA'' Vol. 17 No. 2This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine.The first fully international issue has been published and echoes are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structuredin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the editedpart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan forknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned togive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of thejournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own viewsinto the discourse.   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This pageexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problemswithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into otherconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology (e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write thispage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to getsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to expresstheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of thearea in question.   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation onone side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in whicheditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story shouldbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to havea stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particularnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situationright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or yourcolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to thecontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which freshideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annualreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishingin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even completepapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We receivedseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typedtexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contactperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerningour common interest and job.At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help inevery mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open variouspossibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to giveproposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mailand by other means.Sincerely yours,Anton P.

Thanks.I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains todeal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).Here is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.This might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.	Graeme Gill.###########################################################################"A note on gamma correction and images"Author: Graeme W. Gill        graeme@labtam.oz.auDate: 93/5/16"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?"--------------------------------------Although it would be nice to think that "an image is an image",there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch ofdifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a wholelot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bitcomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloadedimages from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most imageviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and somelook too light. "Why is this ?" you may ask. This, is gamma correction(or the lack of it).Why do we need gamma correction at all ?--------------------------------------Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathoderay tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If youhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computerimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point ofthe scene, then you have created a "linear" or un-gamma-correctedimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulatethe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. addingand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltageand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give youan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of lightcoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltagesomething like this:Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gammaSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the imagewill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to "gamma correct"the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRTwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you getwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?-----------------------------------------------------The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video camerasor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of imagesalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those imageswith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image getscorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of thoseimages with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it willlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction isnot exactly right for you particular CRT.Whose fault is all this ?-----------------------It is really three things. One is all those display programsout there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another isthat most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, ordon't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.The third thing is that not many people understand what gammacorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varyinggamma's.At least two file formats do the right thing.The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recordingthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. alinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor youare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying toview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) andutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gammaof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correctionyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying thegamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to theappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensityin the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails totake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tendsto give a tint to the image. ]How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?---------------------------------------------------------------------The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format filecontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linearto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other usingdithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma correctsimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the pointat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly halfway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps ifyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes abit.)If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will havea long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightnesswill be above the center.If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correctionfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase thegamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually bearound 2.2 [with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMAenvironment variable in your .profile]How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?-------------------------------------------------This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot oftrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gammacorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma correctedto some degree or other.If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images willlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images willlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing-----------------------------------------------------One of the reason that many high quality formats (such asVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes betteruse of the storage medium. This is because the humaneye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correctionhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is thatevery time you want to do any image processing you shouldconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retainthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, andnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standardgamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma correctedimages at the popular level.If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,and if image manipulation software takes care to useextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has astandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get thehighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).###########################################################################From: D.J.Nettleton@newcastle.ac.uk (D J Nettleton)Subject: HELP: A rectangle and parallelogramI hope someone can help me with the following problem - I'm sure theremust be a known solution.Given a rectangle defined by-X <= x <= X  and -Y <= y <= Y  where X and Y are constantand a parallelogram defined by-C1 <= a*x + b*y <= C1  and -C2 <= c*x + d*y <= C2where C1, C2, a, b, c, d are constants and b/a != d/c (i.e. notparallel lines)                                ^^                                          not equal towhat is the area of their intersection?

JPEG is designed for compressing eitherfull-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or linedrawings.JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does ithandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those typesof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEGrespectively.JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn'tquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves muchof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notablythe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small detailsof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, thesmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they areinvisible to the eye.A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied byadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* smallfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing imagearchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if youaren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, youcan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.[2]  Why use JPEG?There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files acrossnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference indisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have toconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Evenwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG imagethan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, usingJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order tostore or transmit an image more cheaply.It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, thetime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than theextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenetposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete asblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailedin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images amongpeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the firstthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color orgray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs andsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixelsthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeedby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but theyshould be avoided in JPEG files.)JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixelsadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, thissort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairlyoften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness isparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall betweenscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex andsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scaleimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale imagesof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether youshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, onlyapplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start froma GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEGcan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I havehandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first threefiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B.File	   Size in bytes		Commentsship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25			 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were			 of poorer image quality than this.ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smallerthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as theGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff byselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of theinformation", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;it's not a percentage of anything.The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable fromthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from oneobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except forexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce afile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able togo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, youmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and areprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 isabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)

Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with supportfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand newand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleedingedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note thatversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll getonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 worksfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is aglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkboxwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  TheImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormappeddisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or thebasic free JPEG software.Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latestrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the currentxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are saidto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.MS-DOS:This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface isnot flashy, but it's functional.Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  Thecurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPUand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows andOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fiton the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that itslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is abit tricky; read the directions carefully!A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface isalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger thanscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and bothare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zipor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-inVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complainsthat the driver is missing.)A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking aroundthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortlyand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latestrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality ispoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of theseviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programsto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If youhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try tofind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.)The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (orjpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOScompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they willconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; inparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The majoradvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietaryJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it isnot readable on non-PC platforms.Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulationpackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programsis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this documentrefers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you shouldexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are severalInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USAmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 filesin (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you canretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings incomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.Microsoft Windows:There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversionprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frillsviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while itdecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out thedecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEGfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other usefulfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it'san excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available fromftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment andslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirrorsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,which is roughly 25% faster.)ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promisingcontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point ithas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, thecurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, filepub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version willbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screenmode, not in a window.OS/2:The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderatoris not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4./pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.Macintosh:Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part ofthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be runningSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also installthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can getQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster andconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, isnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 fordetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing imagesthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also canconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a bigimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 andQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best colorimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView canview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it'sthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on atypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it downto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most otherviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some peoplelike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is verywell thought out.GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF andPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latestversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, butit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversioncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot ofplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter canload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet ifyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, tryconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, isavailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIFconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using thisprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, andGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixiefrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it'sreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it producesrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is anunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does notintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, calledPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trashit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a muchcleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note thatPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, butit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it onolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can'tuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of adownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If youdon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although notall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEGplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloadedJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.Amiga:(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive atamiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of thisarchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a goodchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being ageneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can readseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo versionis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images largerthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, evencapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  Thecurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirrorsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory issupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run underAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packagesthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, andImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both aredistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulationsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is anotherwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas fromamiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, fileAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, manybased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanksto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, withoutso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG","VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk spaceit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.Atari ST:The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-levelgrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Availablefrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers forAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.Acorn Archimedes:!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and viewJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handleJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can befound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available byregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/writefunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other imageformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but notnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.NeXT:ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some formatconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives atsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both arecurrently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specificsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around thatdoes not support JPEG.Portable software for almost any system:If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the freeJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have adisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targaor PPM 24-bit image files.There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up everyday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you findthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whetherthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it canhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases arenot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the IndependentJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current releaseis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget toretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you mayprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available onCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearestcomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQarticle "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and imagefiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in otherprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we havetested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement inproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as withanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like tocontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, thecomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representativecolors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is somethingof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck withthe standard usage though.)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for mostimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impacton the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except atthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for displayon 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, whatcomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a littledifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probablycome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required todisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the imagesource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk aboutthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to countthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give youdifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally seeposted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), butnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in itspalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that thesender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender'squantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors thanwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorerimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantizationalgorithm, you're out of luck.For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image qualityfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's displayhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of futureimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research inthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEGimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what wassent.It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rathershoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGAdisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than youneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two colorquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it'salso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to usehigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and innormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to bedisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the averageGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit displayhardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays onworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is alreadyobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of theirdisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing imagesin a machine-independent fashion.[8]  How does JPEG work?The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosinetransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropycoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee diddefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees thefinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, thislossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEGalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very fewimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficientquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEGalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors invarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixelvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhapshalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEGprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guaranteesbit-for-bit accuracy.If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with lessthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into theJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with aHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee wasprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the internationalstandards organizations.Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree ona common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence ofofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible withanybody else's.The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some workthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have definedtwo JPEG-based file formats:  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports    pixels and not much else.  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the    mix will do anything to improve this situation.Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendorsof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercialproducts will adhere to one or both standards.I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF inpicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; theTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is stillunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is welldefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest commondenominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTimesoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF andQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs areavailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editorthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIFby hand; see section 11 for details.Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF andImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-formatfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likelyto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),    try stripping off everything before that.In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is	"begin" line	M_]C_X ...whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with	"begin" line	M:'-I ...If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble ofdownloading non-JFIF files.[12]  What about arithmetic coding?The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final outputof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usuallyproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by theJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licensesfrom these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implementand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubiousat best.)At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry aboutarithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify thepotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in thefuture.  Stay tuned for further details.[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you coulddecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress itwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an alteredimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost thefirst time around.The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompressit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get anidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventuallydegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generationoutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error canbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be thatcompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the originalquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, butthat's a mighty limited capability!)The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage andtransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediateformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you areready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if youconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the originalfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG fromthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimumloss of quality.The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, tomake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher qualitysetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained insection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colorsdon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the bestcandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offerthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don'texpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those createddirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may haveto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-throughJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-colorborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharpborder boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windowssystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painlessway to do this.)cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, butfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoidimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higherQ setting may not be necessary.)Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to foolyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often ofsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixelstogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  Thetrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequencycolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEGfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would havegotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color thatyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapidcolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing willoften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size ofthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output imagethan you'd get without smoothing.With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothingcapability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handeddithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regularfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strongsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blurthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processingwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such aspnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother isa LOT faster than pnmconvol...The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably agood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about theimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.---------------------For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software inparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.-- 			tom lane			organizer, Independent JPEG GroupInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu	BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegieFrom: broehl@sunee.uwaterloo.ca (Bernie Roehl)Subject: Re: Optimizing projectionsIn article <1sua3tINNqs2@no-names.nerdc.ufl.edu> LIONESS@ufcc.ufl.edu writes:>My three-d library does a lot of projections ( duh ), but currently it>is projecting an object's vertices on a _per triangle basis_.

Here's what you should do.Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay,but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices intothe array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for eachvertex when you transform it, so you don't have to transform any vertexmore than once; you also do backface elimination before processing thepolygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't haveto be transformed at all.Whenever you transform a vertex, check if it's on the far side of the hitherplane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.Then do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have theirprojection done at that stage.-- 	Bernie Roehl        University of Waterloo Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering	Mail: broehl@sunee.UWaterloo.ca	Voice:  (519) 885-1211 x 2607 [work]From: da1-lst@hemul.nada.kth.se (Lars-Erik Stenholm)Subject: Parametric DraftingHello networld!I'm looking for documentation/books on parametric drafting.Does anyone know of such material, electronic on a Gopher/ftp-siteor books/authors.Im not looking for commercial software rather info on implementation and theory of the subject.

If you want to save file under another        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change        directory to what you want. Then,        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                      (filename under bar).  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,     the performance is poor.  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster       (No one is better for true 24bits image)  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested  8. This document is not well written.

Thanks.> The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces offrames (usually stored as .PIC or .CLP files), fonts, and a .TXT filethat tells the GRASP animation system how to display it.  GL standsfor Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subjectin the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.There are freely distributable viewers for GL files, and they are usuallynamed GRASPRT?.EXE (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  MostGL files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modesof the CGA, EGA, or VGA adapters on PCs.  I think that there are somecopies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp (I know that I got one therea long time ago).

I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that handles graphics requests, queued on a mailbox, one at a time.  If this provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the needfor a reentrant graphics library.

Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB,even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'mguessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairlysure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).	I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s whiledisplaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system.	Unless you have a _very_ compelling reason, I'd advise trying to useat least somewhat compressed data.

This I appreciated verymuch . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphicsprogrammer. The subjects are	1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. Iknow somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you todothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the booksand info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is away to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written inassembly, which I don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To getany speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?	2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of whatthe net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most ofthe advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that willtell me in "mostly plain" english how the vesa calls work.	My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books,I have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through bothgopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there issome lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot ofprogrammiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of tellingyou how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, Iknow there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Whereare you, and why haven't you written a book yet?

IMHO the wider meaning is not:  obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to:  be!  [....]:  Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, darkrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the viewgiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker'is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who considerthemselves such.  Following is the definition from "Jargon File 2.9.10".(This is also known as the "Hackers Dictionary".)  The definitions arearranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX     hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password     hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.     The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see     {hacker ethic, the}).     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if     you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and     facilitating access to information and to computing resources     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}     project.     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who     see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})     can function without central control because of this trait; they     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be     hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who: says "Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-)Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describinglimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is betternot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So,in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessaryto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around theworkplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-knownand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way.:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)Language works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language isto communicate.  To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place,then language is working.--|================= #include <stddisclaimer.h> ================///=============|| "AMIGA: The computer for the creative mind" (tm) Commodore /// Weber State  || "Macintosh: The computer for the rest of us"(tm) Apple \\\///   University  ||== "I think, therefore I AMiga" -- val@csulx.weber.edu ==\///= Ogden UT USA =|From: mike@leah.prc.utexas.edu (Michael Kline)Subject: IGES and e00 formatsI am trying to find out anything I can about available documentationfor IGES and e00(Arc/Info) formats.
