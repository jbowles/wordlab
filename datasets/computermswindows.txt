Lots of work ,  and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize . This file includes information on writing a script for University of MinnesotaPHONE ,  and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with PHONE .  For additions ,  modifications and corrections ,  I can be reached at<ashok@biochemistry . cwru . edu>Best wishes , Ashok-- begin SLIP . TXT --Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows ,   hereare my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment .   I thank theTrumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments . ----------------------------------------------------------------------Configuring your Modem : a) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program   and therefore hangs up the line .   If you use a program like Kermit   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection ,  then this need not be done .    These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit .    NOTE :  If you use Univ .  of Minn .  PHONE to dial and establish a         SLIP connection ,  you do not need to turn off DTR . b) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first .   This can be done   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the   SLIP packet driver .   The PHONE scripting language is simple and   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with   other SLIP server .   In addition ,  while the only packet driver   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently) ,  it is easy to write a   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers .    There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and   batch file examples . ----------------------------------------------------------------------Configuring the SLIP drivers : There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly availableCSLIPPER . EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driverSLIPPER . EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driverSLIP8250 . COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver)ETHERSL . COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)UMSLIP . COM      Univ .  of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)Of these four ,  I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER . EXE over SLIP8250 . COM orETHERSL . COM for the following reasons : a) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UARTb) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP ,  myself and several others   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a   long FTP transfer . c) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation moded) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with   every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with . Instructions for C/SLIPPER . EXE (and you do not use PHONE)a) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC . BAT file according to instructions :    For instance if you have a v . 32bis modem on COM1   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600b) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3 . 1 DOS boxes ,  then use the   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT . COM -- this creates a virtual   packet driver at 0x60 .   DOS applications in native mode ,  DOS   applications in Windows 3 . 1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all   use this virtual driver at 0x60 .    winpkt . com 0x60 0x62c) If you use QVT/Net ,  load PKTINT . COM next .   QVT/net is configured in   QVTNET . INI to use the interrupt at 0x60 .    pktint . comInstructions for SLIP8250 . COM : a) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver .   Philip Burns of Northwestern   University has a modified SLIP8250 . COM driver that is better at hardware   handshaking .   This driver is distributed along with NuPOP . b) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection .   My modem is a   V . 32bis modem on COM1 ,  so here is how I would load the driver .    slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600c) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3 . x   DOS boxes ,  you probably want to use WINPKT . COM   winpkt . com 0x60 0x62d) If you use WinQVT/net ,  load PKTINT . COM   pktint . comInstructions for ETHERSL . COM : If you choose to use ETHERSL . COM instead of SLIP8250 . COM ,  theinstructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference .   Youwill have to DELETE the line  " device=*vcd "  from the [386Enh] sectionof SYSTEM . INI .   This will interfere with running regular Windows Commapplications (such as Crosstalk) ,  and you will get lots of droppedcharacters etc .  in these applications .   This is therefore notrecommended .   ETHERSLIP would be loaded as :    ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600----------------------------------------------------------------------Configuring Windows 3 . 1 : a) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM . INI file [386Enh]   section .    i) List all your COM ports ,  with their addresses and interrupts .        COM1Base=03F8       COM1Irq=4       COM2Base=02F8       COM2Irq=3       COM3Base=03E8       COM3Irq=5       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel ,        but double-clicking on the  " Ports "  icon .    ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer       COM1Buffer=10000   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish       to use for your modem to ZERO .   This is the amount of time that       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to       another application .   If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch       from one session to another ,  and this value is at the default value       of 2 seconds ,  you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash .        COM1AutoAssign=0       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel .        Double-click on 386 Enhanced ,  and under  " Device Contention ",  set       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to        " Never Warn " ----------------------------------------------------------------------Additional notes : ----------------------------------------------------------------------What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for eachSLIP session ? I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each usera permanent IP address ,  so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET . INIeach time that I establish a SLIP connection . If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in , please try to use BOOTP aware software ,  and let BOOTP do theconfiguration for you .   However ,  QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARPwill not work over a SLIP connection .   To get QVTNet working in asituation such as this ,  you must do the following : Edit the QVTNET . INI file .   Let the [net] section look like this : [net]name=ip=netmask=255 . 255 . 255 . 0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)arptime=20packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)Save the changes ,  and then *write-protect* this file " attrib +r qvtnet . ini " Start your slip connection ,  and *remember* the name and IP addressthat you are assigned .   Each time you start QVT/net 3 . 1x ,  thegeneral configuration dialog box will open .   Enter the name andIP address and you were assigned for that session ,  click on [OK] , and you should be up and running .   The changes you make will notbe saved ,  as QVTNET . INI is write-protected . A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP addressassignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf . cc . utexas . edu)Victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation . Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP ,  which is then saved to afile called  " myip ".   Another file  " noip "  is essentially a completeQVTNET . INI file that lacks the IP address .   In the final step  " myip " and  " noip "  are copied into a single QVTNET . INI file .   An example ofVictor's batch file is provided below : =====================================================slipper com2pktint . combootpq -i  " ip= \" %%s \""   >> myipbootpq -i  " My IP# is :  %s " copy /q net + myip + noip e :\ com \ qvtnet \ qvtnet . inidel /q myip@echo offecho  . echo Ready to run WinQVTnet=====================================================For questions and more details about bootpq ,  please contact VictorMenayang (victor@ccwf . cc . utexas . edu)QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net . ----------------------------------------------------------------------How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP ? PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250 . COM packet driver ,  and crashesimmediately if used with ETHERSL . COMPKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER . EXE ,  when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernetsimulation mode .   An example of this configuration is shown below : The latest release of PKTMUX is 1 . 2c; and it is important that youuse this version ,  if you want to use virtual packet drivers withapplications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly) . [from AUTOEXEC . BAT]lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)lh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)lh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net)lh pktint . com           (QVT/net pktint . com)pktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from withinWindows 3 . 1 DOS boxes .   For example ,  my PIF file to load POPmail isdirected to the file  " popmail . bat ".   This is what popmail . bat readslike : pktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60cd  \ popmailpopmailcd  \ pktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60exit                    causes the DOS window to closeI have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applicationslike PC Gopher .   It is my experience that PKTMUX works fineeven if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOSsessions ,  are loaded at the same software interrupt .   For examplewithin two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other forGopher ,  the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in eachinstance . ----------------------------------------------------------------------How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER ? I have a V . 32bis/V . 42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3 . 1 witha reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra) .   Under theseconditions ,  when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded andbeing used as follows : a) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client sessionb) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 sessionc) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOSI get FTP transfer rates of 0 . 8 - 1 . 0 kb/sec while transferringcompressed files .   This rate is comparable to that which I get withSLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver ,  and where a single TCP/IP sessionis active .   If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single sessionis active ,  I get transfer rates of 1 . 3 - 1 . 4 kb/sec on the samefiles . While there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER , for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh theperformance hit . ----------------------------------------------------------------------C/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation modeIn ethernet simulation mode ,  C/SLIPPER ver 1 . 3 works with all theapplications that I have tested it with .   One or two applicationsthat required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1 . 2 ,  but eventhese rare problems have been resolved with ver 1 . 3When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode ,  and used with PKTMUX , I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads " IP : incorrect packet type "  or  " IP : bad version number ".   This does notseem to prevent QVTnet from functioning ,  although I cannot comment onloss of performance . ----------------------------------------------------------------------What can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work withC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode ? In the rare event that you find a package that does not work withC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode ,  first contact the author --Peter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet . psychol . utas . edu . au ,  and let himknow .   Chances are that he can fix it . In the meanwhile ,  you can try the following .   I do not know if it iskosher ,  but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1 . 2(C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)I load ETHERSL . COM at 0x60 ,  run the application and then terminateETHERSL . COMThis also works within Windows 3 . 1 virtual DOS boxes .   However apacket driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS boxat a time . So for example ,  here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (amedical reference retrieval program developed at the National Libraryof Medicine) . ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIPcd  \ gm6searchcd  \ termin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIPexit            closes the DOS box and returns me to WindowsIf you use this method ,  be cautious about one thing -- don't haveany active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time .   After closingthe ETHERSL window ,  you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with noproblem .   BTW ,  the example above -- Grateful Med ,  works with noproblems with C/SLIPPER ver 1 . 3----------------------------------------------------------------------PHONE Script Files : The documentation that accompany PHONE ,  provide good instructions onwriting script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other thanthe University of Minnesota server .   For example here is a scriptthat I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend . Background :   To start a SLIP connection ,  I dial our terminal server , and login with a username and password .   After doing so ,  I start a SLIPsession with the following command  " slip username-slip . dialin . cwru . edu ", followed by my password -- again . Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE .

In thisexample ,  the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER .   To use abatch file like this ,  you must know the parameters with which youplan to use the packet driver -- i . e interrupt vector ,  baud rate , port address ,  and IRQ .   This batch file requires UMSLIP . COM , CSLIPPER . EXE ,  and TERMIN . COM to be in the same directoryor in your path  ... All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connectionusing PHONE ,  load the appropriate packet driver ,  hangup theconnection ,  and unload the driver when you are done  ... -- being CWRUSLIP .
