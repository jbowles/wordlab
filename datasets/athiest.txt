Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather thantechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, heremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:"Galactic Pot-Healer"A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to aremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When thedeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright isunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel."A Maze of Death"Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion."VALIS"The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of GnosticChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam ofunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic anddismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters."The Divine Invasion"God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns fromanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must beassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.MARGARET ATWOOD"The Handmaid's Tale"A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriouslyassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to liveunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and theradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punishedretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" arehunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used toat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.VARIOUS AUTHORS"The Bible"This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, itis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss isabout.

In thiswork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for theexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and relyupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values andaesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, weredecisively rejected in Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revisededition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which hemakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.J. L. MACKIE"The Miracle of Theism", OxfordThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principalarguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classicalphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, throughthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatementsof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses thosepositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements forGod" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - lessformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly directwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.JAMES A.

Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not."What is atheism?"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strongatheism".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weakatheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strongatheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials."But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism."What is agnosticism then?"The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only whenreferring to "strong atheism".Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe."So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists."But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "theredefinition game".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separationof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify theiractions.  For example:  "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever."The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation; 5% after.                                ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, allconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.and finally (and most importantly):   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: 2.2iQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/qnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmPq0Z4hSSPpAU==q2V5-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----For information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.From: I3150101@dbstu1.rz.tu-bs.de (Benedikt Rosenau)Subject: Re: Gospel DatingIn article <65974@mimsy.umd.edu>mangoe@cs.umd.edu (Charley Wingate) writes: >>Well, John has a quite different, not necessarily more elaborated theology.>>There is some evidence that he must have known Luke, and that the content>>of Q was known to him, but not in a 'canonized' form.>>This is a new argument to me.

The style and languagetogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument. The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospelof John itself. Is there any other evidence for it? One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare thatto reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.  >>It is also obvious that Mark has been edited.
